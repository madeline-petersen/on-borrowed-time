This anxiety prompted the 1982 Sino-British negotiations on the future of Hong&nbsp;Kong. After two years of discussion, the United Kingdom and PRC governments produced the Joint Declaration. Focusing on the paramount goal of &ldquo;maint[aining] the prosperity and stability of Hong&nbsp;Kong,&ldquo; both sides made important concessions during the negotiations. Britain forfeited its legal rights (pursuant to the post-Opium War treaties) to Hong&nbsp;Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula.

                    "The Joint Declaration aimed to carry out the “one country, two systems” policy, which was originally outlined in Article 31 of the PRC’s 1982 Constitution. The Declaration was the product of several difficult years of Sino-British negotiations in the early 1980s.<br>",
                    "<br/>These talks followed on the heels of PRC leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous 1979 statement that those investing in (or thinking of investing in) the booming commercial and industrial metropolis of Hong&nbsp;Kong should “put their hearts at ease.” Amid the give-and-take of the negotiations, Deng had come to grasp that the preservation of Hong&nbsp;Kong’s distinctive capitalist system—and hence its ability to boost China’s economic development—would depend on a rocklike commitment to the “one country, two systems” model.<br>",
                    "<br/>That model, in turn, aimed to protect Hong&nbsp;Kong from the intrusion of China’s socialist system. The PRC was then in the early stages of reform after the chaos of the 1960s and 1970s, years of turbulence that had culminated in a high-level power struggle following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. Deng’s aim was for Hong&nbsp;Kong to be returned to China in a way that would preserve prosperity and social order and enable the city’s remarkably industrious and enterprising people to contribute to China’s modernization and economic development.<br>",
                    "<br/>He no doubt hoped that this respectful, arms-length approach would kindle Hong&nbsp;Kong’s loyalty in return. In order to work, the model had to win the confidence of Hong&nbsp;Kong’s people. The city’s liberal, free-spirited, capitalistic populace was not going to be reassured by mere pronouncements from a regime that many of them justifiably distrusted. Similarly, the international acceptance needed for foreign governments and enterprises to treat Hong&nbsp;Kong as a distinct entity in their financial and commercial dealings would require more than vague promises.<br>"

                    "In the beginning, many observers discovered that few Beijing leaders had a realistic and accurate understanding of Hong&nbsp;Kong. Those accustomed to viewing the world from the perspectives of a Chinese middle kingdom or Marxist philosophy seemed to be equally ignorant and self-righteous in their opinions about how a capitalist colony like Hong&nbsp;Kong could best be governed. This worried quite a number of the Hong&nbsp;Kong elite. There was much anxiety, and remedial lobbying (educating) efforts were undertaken by leading figures in the early stage of the negotiations. Fortunately, the leaders in Beijing were wise enough to put those in the know in key positions to deal with the British and Hong&nbsp;Kong representatives so that the damage was not too great.<br>",
                    "<br/>Next, the Hong&nbsp;Kong people were also frustrated because they could not take part in the negotiations affecting their own fate. Both the British and the Chinese claimed that they represented the interests of the Hong&nbsp;Kong people, but in fact they were overrepresented in some areas and inadequately represented in others. Throughout the whole process, they could only traverse the halls in Beijing and London to lobby the two negotiating parties. This they did to their own potential peril, since such actions implied their locus of loyalty and could affect future careers. Had Hong&nbsp;Kong been negotiating for postcolonial arrangements on its own, as many former British colonies have done, the situation would certainly have been different."

His warm reception by Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p&rsquo;ing) was a signal of Peking&rsquo;s intent to allow the colony to maintain its traditional status and increasingly to involve it in the push to modernization. On his return, MacLehose quoted Deng as saying that investors in Hong&nbsp;Kong should &ldquo;put their hearts at ease.&rdquo; In short, China&rsquo;s pragmatic post-Mao leaders value Hong&nbsp;Kong as a window on the world and a source of foreign exchange, investment capital and expertise.&rdquo;<br>",

                    "In order to justify &ldquo;one country, two systems,&rdquo; Communist China cannot avoid taking a step backward and announcing publicly that socialism has not yet been achieved in mainland China. Under these circumstances, a careful examination of &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; will reveal the following characteristic:",
                    "<br/><em>Unevenness</em>—In order to account for the discrepancies and discord that might exist in a society operating under two conflicting systems, Peking has stated that the dialectical principle of the &ldquo;unity of contradictions is the basic and most important objective theoretical source of &rsquo;one country, two systems,&rdquo; thus arguing that there is unevenness in the existence and development of things. On the one hand, this interpretation conforms with Mao Tse-tung&rsquo;s belief that &ldquo;contradictions still prevail in a socialist society&rdquo;; on the other hand, it rejects Mao&rsquo;s &ldquo;theory of continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat,&rdquo; proclaiming that two different systems can coexist and that obstacles to socialism do not have to be removed immediately.",
                    "<br/><em>Historicity</em>—Although in 1895 Taiwan was ceded to Japan as a result of its military defeat of the Ch&rsquo;ing government, and in 1842 Hong&nbsp;Kong passed into British hands, both Taiwan and Hong&nbsp;Kong are integral parts of Chinese territory. Peking has linked &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; with Chinese history, saying that it is designed to end the national division and separation caused by the confrontation between the two parties (Nationalist and Communist). &ldquo;One country, two systems&rdquo; has been used by Peking to arouse nationalistic and patriotic sentiment among Chinese, as part of the united &ldquo;frontline&rdquo; for patriotism, for the purpose of achieving the four modernizations and ultimately the reunification of China.<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Realism</em>—The single most important reason for &ldquo;one country and two systems&rdquo; is that socialism is not attractive to and Hong&nbsp;Kong. In exchange for sovereignty, Peking is willing to guarantee their present lifestyles and economic prosperity. For Hong&nbsp;Kong to maintain its status as an international financial centre the capitalist system should be retained. If the current system is changed artificially, its superiority and prosperity will be lost...<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Transition</em>—According to communist theory, human society evolves through stages from primitive communism, slave society, capitalism, socialism, and ultimately to communism. A process of development takes place within each stage. Marx said that socialist society, having been born out of capitalism, still carries tinges of the old capitalist society. Mao elaborated this further by distinguishing between minimum and maximum programs for socialism. Thus, in line with Marxist theory, the current Chinese Communist leadership claims that &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; acts as a &ldquo;historical transition before this country can thoroughly replace the capitalist system with a socialist system.&rdquo; In other words, the two systems will be merged into one after the transitional period.<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Subordination</em>—The scope and definition of the autonomy of Taiwan and Hong&nbsp;Kong will, of course, be decided by the central government in Peking. Governments in Taiwan and Hong&nbsp;Kong will be subordinate governments powerless to declare war, conduct their own defense, foreign affairs, or peace negotiations. Socialism will be the main political system, because the 1 billion people on the mainland will continue to practice socialism. Capitalism will be allowed to exist as a &ldquo;supplement to the development of socialism.&rdquo;<br>"

                    "<br>The model of &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; envisages the co-existence of two distinct legal systems alongside one another. On one side of the border, there is a well established common law system that is based on Western liberalism and the doctrine of separation of powers. The judiciary is the guard-ian of human rights and the rule of law, and enjoys an exclusive power to interpret legislation and declare the common law. On the other side of the border, legal order has been re-established only since 1978. The country is still in the process of seeking a proper model of legal system that befits the characteristics of a developing economic power under a constitution that is shaped by Socialism/Maoism and Chinese history and culture. The Chinese legal system is based on both the socialist system and the civil law system, but it is subject to increasing influence from the common law system in recent years. A major characteristic of the Chinese legal system, as inherited from the socialist tradition, is its rejection of the doctrine of separation of powers. All powers are vested in the supreme soviet, namely the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPC). As an elected body representing the people, the NPC exercises legislative, executive and judicial powers. The power of final interpretation of law is vested in the legislative rather than the judicial organ. While there is gradual acceptance of the desirability of having a judiciary exercising independent adjudicatory power (as opposed to having an independent judiciary), the judiciary on the Mainland remains a relatively weak institution and the PRC Constitution is by and large not justiciable in courts. Thus, there is a huge ideological gap between the two systems. This gap manifests itself and results in conflicts when the two systems interact with one another. The Basic Law itself provides the best example of the interface of the two systems. In Ma Wai Kwan Davidv HKSAR, Chief Judge Chan described perceptively the nature of the Basic Law as follows:<br>",
                    "<br/>&ldquo;The Basic Law is a unique document. It reflects a treaty made between two nations. It deals with the relationship between the sovereign and an autonomous region which practises a different system. It stipulates the organisations and functions of the different branches of government. It sets out the rights and obligations of the citizens. Hence, it has at least three dimensions: international, domestic and constitutional. It must also be borne in mind that it was not drafted by common law lawyers. It was drafted in the Chinese language with an official English version but the Chinese version takes precedence in case of discrepancies. That being the background and features of the Basic Law, it is obvious that there will be difficulties in the interpretation of its various provisions.&rdquo;<br>",
                    "<br/>&ldquo;Alongside the huge ideological gap and the vastly different stages of development between the HKSAR and the Mainland legal systems lies the great imbalance of political powers between the Special Administrative Region and its sovereign. When there is no clear demarcation of when two systems end and one country begins, and when mutual trust has not been fully established, it is not surprising that attempts were made by both sides to explore and perhaps also to exploit the boundary separating the two systems. This inevitably leads to controversies and conflicts, and is best exemplified by the conflicts arising from the dual nature of the Basic Law as a piece of national legislation of the PRC and as a constitution of the HKSAR. In a way, the first decade of constitutional experience in Hong&nbsp;Kong can be said to be a story of a delicate exploration in an uncharted sea.&rdquo;<br>"

In addition to pasting up eulogies, memorial couplets, and posters, students made speeches, set up symbolic biers, and delivered wreaths to the Square. Some even demanded to attend the funeral. In a single day, ninety-three handwritten memorial couplets appeared at the Beijing University of Science and Engineering."

                    "I remember lying prone on a balcony on the sixth floor of the Beijing Hotel with the Newsweek photographer Charlie Cole, photographing the event around noon on 4 June,” Franklin recalls. “Earlier that day Tiananmen Square had been cleared by the Chinese Army. However, a group of civilians lined up to face a double row of soldiers who themselves stood in firing positions in front of a column of tanks. These civilians were shot at repeatedly, leaving at least twenty casualties. As the bodies were carried away the standoff died down and a column of tanks broke through, moving slowly eastwards. Waiting for them a few hundred metres down the road was a man in a white shirt and dark trousers, carrying two shopping bags. Alone he blocked the path of the tanks, watched by groups of nervous bystanders and perhaps fifty journalists, camera crews and photographers on balconies on almost every floor of the hotel."

The amendments were as follows: 1) The clause &ldquo;subvert the Central People&rsquo;s Government&rdquo; was replaced by &ldquo;treason&rdquo;; and 2) The clause &ldquo;any act of treason, secession, sedition or theft of state secrets&rdquo; was inserted to replace &ldquo;any act designated to undermine national unity.&rdquo; Article 23, (the previous Article 22), was drafted as follows: The Hong&nbsp;Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or theft of state secrets. 26 There was no explanation offered as to why these particular offenses were included in Article 23, although it was clear that the amendment took into consideration both the existing Hong&nbsp;Kong and Mainland Chinese laws and China&rsquo;s political concerns. It was a compromise that seemed to satisfy both sides. China was satisfied because both treason and subversion were offenses in its criminal laws, and treason at common law was broad enough to absorb much &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; behavior. China&rsquo;s national security was sufficiently protected by these additional three offenses. The compromise was also acceptable to Hong&nbsp;Kong because subversion and undermining national unity were replaced by treason and other offenses, which were defined with some sort of clarity and also had a long history at common law."

They were disillusioned with the Chinese government and its promises to Hong&nbsp;Kong by the sudden twists and turns of events on the mainland. The sudden outpouring of emotions and political activism among the Hong&nbsp;Kong Chinese, especially the Hongkongese, can be interpreted as a vivid expression of the Hong&nbsp;Kong identity, which in this case was also shared to a substantial degree by those who identified themselves as Chinese. The year 1989 can thus be considered as a milestone in the formation of the local identity among the Hong&nbsp;Kong Chinese."

                    "</br>Baroness Ewart-Biggs rose to call attention to the problems facing the government and people of Hong&nbsp;Kong and to the responsibilities of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government in this matter; and to move for Papers.<br>",
                    "</br>Lord Willoughby de Broke My Lords, I am fully aware of the great privilege accorded to me in making my maiden speech in this historic House. I trust that I shall not overstep the boundaries of convention which bind maiden speakers, but I share with the noble Baroness her concern for the future of the people and territory of Hong&nbsp;Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>In December 1984, during the debate on the joint agreement with China, my great friend Lord Birkenhead made his maiden speech. Sadly, Robin Birkenhead is now dead but I should like to remind your Lordships of his words. On that occasion he said: &ldquo;we do not have to live, except in our consciences, with the consequences of this agreement; the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong do. Many of them have risked their lives and abandoned everything to escape from Communism. One cannot possibly expect enthusiasm at the prospect of being handed back to a Communist power, however many safeguards are built into their return&rdquo;.—[Official Report, 10/12/84; col. 32.] That was four and a half years ago and today we must address ourselves urgently to the same question.<br>",
                    "</br>Appalling as were the recent events in Peking, they should not have come as a surprise. There had already been a dress rehearsal in Tibet for the brutalities committed in Tiananmen Square. On at least four separate occasions during the past three years—and most recently in March of this year—Chinese troops and police opened fire on and killed unarmed demonstrators. That happened in spite of the fact that freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of demonstration are protected under Article 35 of the Constitution of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. But to its shame the world ignored the warnings from Tibet until minds were wonderfully concentrated by the events on 3rd and 4th June. If the mask had slipped in Tibet, it has now been ripped away and the face of totalitarian China has been exposed.<br>",
                    "</br>That is the power to which we are to hand over Hong&nbsp;Kong and with no more guarantee than the hope that China will abide by the joint agreement. gut after the experience of the past three weeks the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong need more than hope to persuade them that they are not to be delivered defenceless to the mercies of the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army. They need the assurance that if the worst comes to the worst they have in the last resort somewhere to go; an alternative to the bullet and the confession.",
                    "</br>Whereas under the process of decolonisation other Crown colonies were led to or took the path to independence, as the noble Baroness has said, that option was denied to Hong&nbsp;Kong. The right of domicile in the United Kingdom was progressively removed between 1962 and 1981 under the Commonwealth Immigration Act and its subsequent amendments.<br>",
                    "</br>Over the past three weeks the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong have experienced kaleidoscopic emotions: first, of pride and happiness for their fellow countrymen in China as the prospect of greater freedom rose before them; then of anger, shock and compassion; and, finally, of apprehension and fear that what happened in China and Tibet today would happen tomorrow in Hong&nbsp;Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>What is now needed to restore the confidence of Hong&nbsp;Kong is the recognition that we have certain inescapable obligations and that the necessary steps will be taken to meet them. Speedier progress to democratic government, yes; a Bill of Rights, yes. However, they are the icing and what is needed is the cake. They can be no substitute for the fundamental need for an ultimate sanctuary.<br>",
                    "</br>The course advocated by the present Governor, Sir David Wilson, is that we should grant full British passports to the 1.25 million people who currently hold British National (Overseas) passports and to the further 2 million people who are eligible to hold them. I do not believe that such a generous step would mean an unmanageable influx of immigrants from Hong&nbsp;Kong. Their lives are in Hong&nbsp;Kong and they would wish to continue to live there. Paradoxically, the assurance that people could leave would have the effect of encouraging them to stay, for a prison to which you have the key is no longer a prison.<br>",
                    "</br>For my part, I do not believe it quite necessary to go so far as to give immediate right of abode to those 3.25 million who are potentialy eligible in Hong&nbsp;Kong. Certainly those most at risk should have that right and I urge the Government substantially to increase the degree of flexibility in awarding full British passports.<br>",
                    "</br>If Portugal with its smaller population can give to over 100,000 of the citizens of Macao the right of abode in the EC, we can surely give several hundred thousand passports to the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong. I mention the EC because of course by 1992 a British passport will also be a passport to Europe and not all the Hong&nbsp;Kong people will wish to make their home here in the United Kingdom.<br>",
                    "</br>The numbers may seem daunting but this Government have never shirked a challenge. If France has absorbed nearly 2 million immigrants from its overseas territories, we can surely do no less for our subjects in far more deserving circumstances. If Europe&rsquo;s population is increased by a maximum of 1 per cent., that is a tiny price to pay for saving a brave nation from the worst horrors of communism.<br>",
                    "</br>I do not say that Armageddon is coming. However, I say that if it does come we should be prepared. I urge the Government to take the decisions which will satisfy both our honour and our responsibility.<br>",
                    "</br>3.34pm<br>",
                    "</br>Baroness Young—My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for introducing this important debate today and also by congratulating my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke on his maiden speech.<br>",
                    "</br>This debate comes almost exactly one year since we last debated Hong&nbsp;Kong and it is difficult to overstate the change in the situation since that occasion. We have all been appalled by the actions of the Chinese Government over the treatment of the peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square, and no one can ever forget the spectacle on our television screens of the Chinese army literally crushing students who were peacefully trying to express their point of view. We are horrified at the death penalties 233carried out, with more unquestionably to come. Those actions have shocked and appalled the entire world. I express for everyone, I am sure, our deepest sympathy and understanding for the very real concerns of the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>Arising from that dreadful background it is all the more important to consider carefully what the reaction of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government should be to this issue of Hong&nbsp;Kong. I start by placing on record my support for my right honourable and learned friend the Foreign Secretary and the measures that he has already taken against China: a ban on arms sales; a suspension of all scheduled exchanges between Britain and China; a suspension of the visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales; and suspension of all high-level military contacts. I also think that we greatly benefit from my right honourable friend&rsquo;s wise counsel on the situation in Hong&nbsp;Kong and his unwillingness, in my view quite properly, to be pushed precipitously into actions which in many cases have not been fully thought through.<br>",
                    "</br>I am glad that my right honourable and learned friend is to visit Hong&nbsp;Kong shortly. He can then judge for himself the situation on the ground and, above all, can assure the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong that we shall fulfil our obligations and responsibility for the administration of Hong&nbsp;Kong up to 1997. I also place on record my support for the governor, Sir David Wilson, in these difficult times and for the excellent job that he is doing.<br>",
                    "</br>What, then, should we do? The fact is that the historic and geographical realities of the situation of Hong&nbsp;Kong remain. Any viable future for Hong&nbsp;Kong must be dependent upon its co-operation and coexistence with China. Nothing can alter those facts, disagreeable though they may be. Under the lease, 92 per cent. of Hong&nbsp;Kong reverts to China in 1997. I recall, as a Foreign Office Minister, commending to your Lordships the Hong&nbsp;Kong agreement—the Sino-British Agreement on Hong&nbsp;Kong. I believe it to be a good agreement. Some people have suggested that we should either scrap it or try to renogotiate it. I believe that that would be a great mistake. We want to see it implemented. Nor is there any evidence that if we did reopen negotiations we would get a better agreement.<br>",
                    "</br>One further positive point remains. It is in China&rsquo;s long-term interests to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong&nbsp;Kong. As all speakers have said, we must try to keep up that confidence in Hong&nbsp;Kong. I welcome the proposals that have been made for an increase in democracy. I also welcome the fact that the Hong&nbsp;Kong police force has been strengthened under the control of the Hong&nbsp;Kong Government. I hope that on the tragic situation of the Vietnamese refugees there will be some improvement arising from the discussions at Geneva. That seems to be the case.<br>",
                    "</br>Attention has focused on the question of whether, given the changed situation, we should give an undertaking of the right of abode to some 3.25 million people from Hong&nbsp;Kong. It is a matter of much regret to me that I have not been able to speak, before this debate, to Dame Lydia Dunn, who I 234know is in London, and to hear, first hand, her concerns. Of course we all understand their fears. Who could not? I shall therefore listen with great interest to what my noble friend the Minister has to say this afternoon on the point raised about a further examination, particularly under the nationality Acts, of the position of Crown servants and key business people. I was also interested to read what my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in another place yesterday, when she referred to increased flexibility under the nationality Acts. Both statements I welcome, and I hope that my noble friend can say something further on this matter.<br>",
                    "</br>On the wider issue of whether or not we should give a right of abode to the 3.25 million people in Hong&nbsp;Kong I would like to expand further, but time does not allow. But I say this: it is an immensely difficult issue. The British Parliament must not only consider its obligations to the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong, real and important as those are, but also its obligations to the people of the United Kingdom. Indeed, as the representatives in another place are elected to represent the people of the United Kingdom, their first duty must be to the people whom they represent. In answering this question I believe it must be clear that Britain could not guarantee a right of abode to all these people.<br>",
                    "</br>I believe there is a danger as regards the insurance argument because no government could make that commitment without being prepared to make arrangements to receive for right of abode 3.25 million people. It really would not be fair to the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong, let alone to the people in this country, to pretend otherwise. Those who have to take responsibility often have to say things that they would rather not say and that are very painful and disagreeable. I believe that this is one instance of them. That said, we have all referred to what is called the Armageddon situation. We must profoundly hope and pray that it does not happen. From what my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, I recognise that should that situation arise we shall seek the help of the rest of the world in trying to resolve what will be not only a desperately tragic situation for Hong&nbsp;Kong, but a tragedy for the whole world.<br>"

                    "Memory is dangerous in a country that was built to function on national amnesia. A single act of public remembrance might expose the frailty of the state’s carefully constructed edifice of accepted history, scaffolded in place over a generation and kept aloft by a brittle structure of strict censorship, blatant falsehood and wilful forgetting. That’s why a five-foot-tall, 76-year-old grandmother poses enough of a threat that an escort of state security agents, at time as many as 40 strong, has trailed her to the vegetable market and the dentist.<br>",
                    "</br>&ldquo;They knew you were coming,&rdquo; were Zhang Xianling’s first words to me, delivered with a welcoming smile as she swung open the door of the tidy ninth-floor apartment in a drab high-rise block. She spoke lightly, as if she were commenting on the weather or the price of pork. Zhang Xianling resembled nothing more than the archetypal Chinese grandma, a stoutly comforting presence with her short, tidy, grey hair, roomy slacks, and bright blue zip-up cardigan. But her appearance did nothing to mask her redoubtable personality and extraordinary resilience.<br>",
                    "</br>The local police station had called, she explained, to ask whether she would be going out that morning, and was she, by the way, expecting a visitor today? A foreigner perhaps? With a gleam of satisfaction, she confessed that she had told her interlocutor she was expecting the friend of a friend, someone who might be a “foreign Chinese person” or even a “Chinese foreigner of some sort”, a neat summary of my mixed racial heritage. Her approach, deploying equal quantities of directness and obfuscation, has been refined over two decades of contact with the state security apparatus."

                    "I attended several vigils over the years. I learned more about June 4, struggling to make sense of a history that I was too young to bear witness to. I learned about Deng Xiaoping’s Opening Up and Reform movement in the 1980s, a moment of sudden and exhilarating change: as a market economy was introduced, state control over culture was loosened, and for the first time, foreign ideas flowed freely into the country—from KFC to Sartre to rock n’ roll. I learned how those very reforms brought rampant corruption, widespread inequality, and the desire for political change that eventually drove the students to Tiananmen Square. I read about rival student groups: those who wanted democratic reform without challenging the Party and those who wanted the Party overthrown. I read about the factions within the Party itself: the reformists urging for compromise and the hardliners calling for crackdown. I looked elsewhere, studying democracies (what was it that birthed and sustained them?) and autocracies (why did some change while others remained stubbornly in place?). I learned the theories of intellectuals and activists, from Vaclav Havel to Martin Luther King Jr. I picked up compound nouns like civil society and grassroots mobilization and incremental reform. I wanted to understand what had gone wrong at Tiananmen Square. I wanted to know what could’ve been changed then, what could still be changed now, and who had the power to do the changing.<br>",
                    "</br>The more I read, the fewer answers I found. No book felt as certain as the warmth of the gathering in Victoria Park. No work of theory gave me that feeling that had driven me to seek it out in the first place. In time, I came to learn that there was actually a noun for that feeling. Common sense, Hannah Arendt called it—the shared reality that allows us to know ourselves, to know how we are connected to others, and to know how we belong to a common truth. It was common sense that taught us Hong Kongers to remember, uphold, and defend a truth that everybody else had chosen to forget. It was common sense that moved me and so many others to show up to the vigil, year after year, to gather and sing and pray. Vigil: the word derives from the Latin vigilia, or &ldquo;awake.&rdquo; Our vigils were as much an act of mourning as one of deliberate, collective wakefulness."

During the poignant ceremony, participants would light candles, sing pro-democracy songs, listen to survivors’ testimonies and perform Chinese funeral rituals to mourn the people killed in the crackdown. Although most mourners did not participate directly in the movement, the ritualistic practices would serve as their annual reminder of the momentous event. Such practices would reopen the repository of history, allowing them to revisit, and possibly preserve and pass on, the painful memories of the crackdown—which have been heavily censored and suppressed in mainland China to the present day."

Because Hong&nbsp;Kong has become a highly developed economic center, the economic and social implications of this transfer are far-reaching. Business is the soul of Hong&nbsp;Kong; the colony&rsquo;s survival will depend on China&rsquo;s tolerance of a &ldquo;capitalist enclave on its socialist soil.&rdquo; British and Chinese officials entered into talks relating to the transfer in 1982. These talks concluded with the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong&nbsp;Kong (Joint Declaration) in 1984. The Joint Declaration states that Hong&nbsp;Kong will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC and retain a high degree of autonomy as a capitalist system for at least fifty years after 1997.<br></br>",
                    "The Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, however, dissolved Hong&nbsp;Kong residents&rsquo; confidence in the Joint Declaration, and many began to doubt whether their personal liberties and lifestyles would truly remain protected after the takeover date of July 1, 1997. In 1990, the Basic Law-the law which will govern Hong&nbsp;Kong for the fifty years after the takeover-was promulgated after debate and numerous objections by the members of the drafting committee from Hong&nbsp;Kong. In many respects, the Basic Law is inconsistent with the Joint Declaration and the PRC constitution.&lsquo;Furthermore, in 1997, the Basic Law, as well as future Hong&nbsp;Kong legislation will be subordinate to the PRC constitution, and China will ultimately be in charge.&rsquo; <br></br>",

The United States, Canada, and Australia began to receive large numbers of requests for immigration from Hong&nbsp;Kong residents.

                    "Although not everyone who says he will leave will do so, the idea of emigration is pervasive. There have been two Chinese-language comedies on television — Priceless Adventure and Uncle Bill and Aunt Lydia — that draw on emigration for a theme. In my middle-class neighborhood Chu&rsquo;s Photo Shop displays a poster demonstrating that it can take pictures of the exact style and quality required for Canadian and U.S. visas. At a newsstand nearby I can buy the Hong&nbsp;Kong Standard, which regularly publishes a separate section on Canada. If I buy the South China Morning Post instead, I may come across an ad for fur-lined raincoats, clearly aimed at the Canada-bound. Or I can buy The Emigrant, a glossy Chinese-English magazine, circulation 25,000, which offers tips and background information for would-be emigrants. The pages are filled with display ads from moving companies, a pet transport service, and emigration consultants, who seek out business opportunities and help with the paperwork. A short walk beyond the newsstand, a real-estate office advertises mock-Tudor houses in Britain and a tour agency books flights on Canadian Airlines International, which offers more than twice as many flights to Canada as it did five years ago. At the airport one can buy books like Successful Migrating to Australia and New Zealand — An Ideal Destination for Migrants and even picture books of Belize, which, until it stopped the program in late 1989 had sold citizenship to several hundred worried Hong&nbsp;Kong residents for a bargain price of $23,800."

                    "I am currently a 16-year-old junior at Hong&nbsp;Kong International School, the only American high school here. I was born in San Francisco, where both of my parents moved from Hong&nbsp;Kong when they were quite young, and I lived there for about six years. Having begun my life in a pretty typical American environment, I wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled as a first grader when my father&rsquo;s business brought our family to Hong&nbsp;Kong. It took me a couple of years before I finally grew accustomed to our new life, and even longer before I gladly accepted the move. For the longest time, I was a nagging daughter, asking at least once a week when we were going to &ldquo;go back&rdquo; to the States. Over the years, however, Hong&nbsp;Kong has really grown on me. Although I&rsquo;m definitely going back to the US for college and, hopefully, my career, I&rsquo;m in no way ruling Hong&nbsp;Kong, this unique place, out of my future.<br></br>",
                    "I&rsquo;d say that the community I live in is quite different, and maybe even a little removed, from what people would call &ldquo;Hong&nbsp;Kong society&rdquo;. My school is pretty much a community in and of itself, rather remotely located in the south side of the island, which is sort of like a suburb of Hong&nbsp;Kong. Many of the students live in this area, as well. A large part of the student body is made up of expatriates from the US. Of course, if you took a sampling of our student population, you&rsquo;d find among them a number of locals, ABCs (American-born Chinese) such as myself, Canadians, and many others from various countries all over the world. Oftentimes I feel that we at the Hong&nbsp;Kong International School live in a world almost separate from that of the rest of the people in Hong&nbsp;Kong, not really being able to know how the locals think and feel. My school has a reputation for affluence, and this contributes to furthering the distance between the greater community and our own. Even so, my community is strongly impacted by what goes on in Hong&nbsp;Kong, especially by the changes taking place regarding the handover that will take place in about two months.<br></br>",
                    "When I was younger, the year 1997, which has carried much significance to the people here for the past decades, always seemed far away. I never expected it to come so soon; I always thought my family would have moved back to the States by the time it arrived. So, I was taken a bit by surprise when, during my recent visit to the US for the Christmas holidays, I found myself feeling solemn among the noise-makers and streamers of the cheerful revelers who welcomed in the New Year. To my ears, their shouts of &ldquo;1997!&rdquo; had a rather ominous ring.<br></br>",
                    "Personally, I&rsquo;m sorry to see Britain go after having established a very successful system in a prospering city. At the same time, I have mixed feelings about China taking over again. On the one hand, as a Chinese person, I should be proud that my &ldquo;mother country,&rdquo; so to speak, is regaining control of something that is rightfully hers. I also have some faith that China will be sensible enough to leave the freedom and autonomy of Hong&nbsp;Kong&rsquo;s people alone. On the other hand, I fear that the plays for power going on right now between locals, Chinese leaders, and a few remaining figures of British authority may contribute to a possible downfall of our flourishing colony. Ultimately, I hope that China will respect the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; agreement and will make decisions that will ensure the stability and continuation of Hong&nbsp;Kong&rsquo;s success.<br></br>",
                    "As the British move out and the Chinese come back in, many people&rsquo;s lives are going to be dramatically affected. There are locals who have emigrated to other countries—mostly to the US, Canada and Australia—and are staying there. There are also many who have recently come back from these countries to live in Hong&nbsp;Kong for the meantime; they had initially left so that a door would be open for them just in case something should happen here that might threaten their safety. However, there are locals who can&rsquo;t afford to leave Hong&nbsp;Kong, who just have to stay here and see what happens.<br></br>",
                    "My situation is a bit different. Having originally come to Hong&nbsp;Kong from the States as an American citizen, I don&rsquo;t have as much to worry about. I can basically leave any time I want to, and I don&rsquo;t plan to remain here permanently, anyway. I&rsquo;m staying here for another year to finish my senior year of high school, and then going back to the US for college. My parents, also US citizens, can leave if they feel the need to. They are both working here, however, and are unsure about their future. At the moment,they are looking at possibly staying for a few more years and then returning to the US, or maybe somewhere else in Asia where business opportunities exist. Like most others in Hong&nbsp;Kong, my family faces an uncertain future, but I hope things will remain stable here when the Chinese take over so that nothing drastic comes to pass."

                    "At this very instant, the neon red digits on a clock in the heart of Beijing are flashing away audaciously, counting down to the second exactly how much time is left until the historic handover takes place. When I went to Beijing this summer, I was chilled to the bone as I stared at these incessantly blinking numbers, and realized there was only one year left. Now there is a mere month left, according to the ‘handover clock&rsquo; recently installed at the local Regent Hotel, and I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to believe July 1st is approaching so quickly...<br></br>",
                    "Just the other day, a reporter from a major Hong&nbsp;Kong newspaper came to the school I attend, qhixh is in a rather affluent area. He approached me and two of my friends with some questions that really started me thinking and helped me to realize some things. Among them, one in particular stands out prominently in my thoughts. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t have a foreign passport and didn&rsquo;t have the means to obtain one, how would you feel about the nearing handover knowing you would have to stay in Hong&nbsp;Kong indefinitely?&rdquo; he asked.<br></br>",
                    "All three of us remained silent for quite a while, not knowing how to answer. As I turned the matter over in my head for a few moments, I realized how fortunate many of us in my community are. We are free from many of the worries and concerns that burden the lives of countless local people. While those like myself have the comfort of knowing that we can leave the territory any time things get out of hand or in the case we are forced to change our way of life, others don&rsquo;t. They have to stay here and comply with whatever China demands. For this reason, I honestly hope that the Chinese will be reasonable and understanding of the needs of the people, although in the past, they have often acted otherwise towards their citizens. I also fear that a loss of freedom of speech and of the press will silence all complaints and opportunities for negotiation, which are presently open and vital to the locals here. Although it probably doesn&rsquo;t affect me directly, the more I think about them, I&rsquo;m becoming increasingly concerned about these issues.<br></br>",
                    "Because the majority of the students in my community are similarly free from much worry about the imminent transition, many of them, sadly, don&rsquo;t have much interest in what is going to happen in the very near future. As one of my friends explained to the newspaper reporter a few days ago, many of us see it nothing more than a significant historic event. Most locals, on the other hand, view China&rsquo;s return as something with the potential to greatly interfere in their everyday lives. Personally, as time approaches that fateful midnight hour, my interest is becoming increasingly stirred up. I wait not only in excited anticipation of the countless festivities and parties --planned years ahead of time--that will accompany the handover, but also with anxious apprehension over how Hong&nbsp;Kong will be reshaped once the fervor dies down.<br></br>",
                    "As somewhat tacky, over-the-top souvenirs flood the shops, along with the an overwhelming number of camera-toting tourists who to pour in daily, I wonder how so many of my classmates can leave the territory for the summer holidays before the end of June, knowing they are missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take part in such a momentous piece of history-in-the-making. As for myself, I am profoundly grateful for the chance to eyewitness this event will bring thousands from around the world to Hong&nbsp;Kong.<br></br>"

The mass media and pro-Beijing organisations are creating a joyful atmosphere for the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong. But are we really happy?<br></br>",
                    "For myself, the end of the colonial rule is certainly great. Even though Hong&nbsp;Kong has been ruled by Britain more than 150 years. I have strong feelings of connection to my motherland. When my family and I were watching the Olympic Games, we concerned ourselves with the performance of China&rsquo;s teams and were proud of their victories. Few Hong&nbsp;Kong people, I believe, would deny their Chinese indentities. In this sense, we are eager to see the reunification. But there are doubts as well.<br></br>",

                    "Why, merely a few days before the sovereignty handover, do so many Hong&nbsp;Kong people still not share the joy? It is because the government-in-waiting is still not able to give us a satisfactory arrangement in terms of our political system and human rights protections.<br></br>",
                    "The news reports of Tiananmen Square now filled with Beijing people taking photos, and waving the five-star PRC (Chinese) flag along with the bauhinia-embellished flag of HKSAR (Hong&nbsp;Kong) seemed ironically funny to me. The streets of Beijing are full of decorations in honour of the handover. However, in Hong&nbsp;Kong, such scenery is not as easy to find. When interviewed by journalists, some Honk Kong people said that the most significant thing about the handover was that they would get a five-day vacation in its honour. Other people also complained the media coverage of handover was &ldquo;too much&rdquo; and decided to travel abroad during this time.<br></br>",
                    "For the businessmen, the handover is a good opportunity. In addition to the summer and Christmas sales, we now have reunification sales in the retail stores. Someone questioned whether it is appropriate and justifiable for the government to spend millions of dollars on the celebrations, while our elderly citizens receive only is about $300 (US) a month, an amount the government has refused to increase.<br></br>",
                    "Academics have warned of the potential for social unrest; this worries me, too. As our community is presented to the world in bubbles of prosperity and happiness, we will experience great disappointment if, after the handover, we are faced with a series of restrictions on our civil liberties, a pushing back of the democratic movement, an unhealthy rise in property prices and an increasing disparity of wealth. However, I hope that Hong&nbsp;Kong people will think more about these things and not bury our heads in the sand.<br></br>"

                    "Hong&nbsp;Kong is quite acquainted with having planeloads of tourists coming in to explore its outer islands, historical sites, and quaint souvenir-shops. In fact, the tourist industry here has been extremely successful for as long as I can remember. At present, however, there has been an obvious increase in the number of people walking around the streets carrying cameras and speaking less familiar languages. Most notable has been the increase in the number of Mandarin-speaking people (the languages usually spoken in Hong&nbsp;Kong are Cantonese and English), heralding the arrival of the many more mainlanders to come in the next few years.<br></br>",
                    "The whole atmosphere of Hong&nbsp;Kong is changing, and one can almost sense a different feeling in the air. What I am most impressed with, however, is the attention the international media are giving to Hong&nbsp;Kong. Before the approach of this prodigious event, most people had no idea where Hong&nbsp;Kong was and probably didn&rsquo;t even care that much. Now, the world is being given the opportunity to focus its attention here and learn to a little about a place they never knew much about before.<br></br>",
                    "The whole city is pretty much buzzing right now. The upcoming event is all many people can talk about, and local newspapers just can&rsquo;t print enough material concerning the handover. There has been so much fuss about it that many people have acquired what has jokingly been labelled as &ldquo;handover fatigue&rdquo;. Nevertheless, I have been enjoying the excitement.<br></br>",
                    "The stately skyline has been set ablaze with the colorful lights that decorate the buildings; the streets are adorned with banners. There have been countless special events, shows, concerts, exhibitions, parties, etc., going on every day for the two months that preceded the transition. Some of these mark the sad farewell Britain is bidding the crown colony it fostered for so long. Others joyously proclaim China&rsquo;s proud reunification with its long-lost entity. In either case, strong nationalism exudes from both sides.<br></br>",
                    "Just the other night, I attended a concert given by the English military marching bands, who are due to set sail back to the UK in a couple of days. As the familiar strains of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; reached my ears, I saw the governor Chris Patten as well as many other British proudly singing to the tune. It was a sentimental moment, and I could feel the dignified sadness they were experiencing . These British people are concluding a prosperous rule here, and many are preparing to return to their homes. On the other hand, the glimpses of Chinese performances I&rsquo;ve caught on the news have all been very bright—and a little overly-optimistic in my opinion.<br></br>",
                    "Within my own group of relatives and close friends, &ldquo;celebrations&rdquo; are also being planned. On the night of June 30th, I will be getting together with my mother&rsquo;s side of the family at a relative&rsquo;s house for a big dinner. We&rsquo;ll be watching the fireworks from her balcony and witnessing the handover ceremony on TV. On July 1st, I&rsquo;m eating another big dinner with my dad&rsquo;s side of the family as well as some friends, several of whom have flown over from the States. Many of my friends are doing something similar, while some whom I&rsquo;ve talked to still haven&rsquo;t planned anything yet. I anticipate a smooth transition and hope that nothing very drastic will occur to disrupt Hong&nbsp;Kong&rsquo;s normal peaceful atmosphere. It&rsquo;s only a matter of days until the world will be able to witness this century-long awaited event!<br></br>"

Even though they did not share political fate with the mainland Chinese before 1997, Hong&nbsp;Kong Chinese still had tremendous empathy with their fellow compatriots. To many Hong&nbsp;Kong Chinese, colonial rule, though basically benign and tolerable, was still demeaning and occasionally outrageous. Racial discrimination, though increasingly taking a subtle form, was still an intrinsic feature of colonial rule which constantly reminded the colonized of their common Chineseness. Undoubtedly, communism was repulsive to the Hong&nbsp;Kong Chinese, but the fact that the Chinese Communists had performed the feats of shaking China off from foreign control and building China into a major power in the world had left a strong, albeit paradoxical, impression on them. Still, as Hong&nbsp;Kong was a sanctuary to many people there, Chinese nationalism and anti-colonialism had never been potent forces in shaping the identity of the Hong&nbsp;Kong Chinese. Though a small portion of the Hong&nbsp;Kong Chinese supported either the communist regime in the mainland or the nationalist regime in Taiwan, most were however politically detached."

Nowhere in their thinking was there much room for Hong&nbsp;Kong&rsquo;s local population, whom until recent memory were barred from the clubs, management suites and halls of government.

Supposedly, Britain&rsquo;s handover in less than 750 days of Hong Kong, the world&rsquo;s most aggressively pro-business economy, to China, the world&rsquo;s largest still officially communist dictatorship, is going to be a nonevent. Like the loyal retainers in the tale of the emperor who wore no clothes, Chinese and Western dignitaries continue to insist--despite growing evidence to the contrary--that, as Lord Young, chairman of British telecommunications giant Cable & Wireless, declared recently, &ldquo;the best years for Hong Kong lie ahead.&rdquo; In fact, the naked truth about Hong Kong&rsquo;s future can be summed up in two words: It&rsquo;s over.<br></br>",

With its six million enterprising citizens (mostly Overseas Chinese), its magnificent harbor, and financial wealth that includes some $52 billion in government reserves alone, Hong Kong will remain the gateway to fast-growing South China (see following story). As such it will continue to be, as one local billionaire puts it, &ldquo;a place where you can make plenty of money.&rdquo;<br></br>",
                    "What&rsquo;s indisputably dying, though, is Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a vibrant international commercial and financial hub--home to the world&rsquo;s eighth-largest stock market, 500 banks from 43 nations, and the busiest container port on earth. Last year this cosmopolitan metropolis&rsquo;s unique blend of unfettered capitalism and minimal taxation earned it the title of &ldquo;world&rsquo;s best city for business&rdquo; in a survey of executives conducted by Fortune. But as Hong Kong becomes a captive colony of Beijing and increasingly begins to resemble just another mainland city, governed by corruption and political connections rather than the even-handed rule of law, it seems destined to become a global backwater.<br></br>"

Nevertheless, the earlier experience of colonialism as well as Hong&nbsp;Kong’s prolonged separation from mainland China have provided impetus for the local population to maintain a distance from the traumatic events in China during the 1950s and 1960s, to experience modernity differently, and to express alternative images of ‘citizenship,’ which include the ‘othering’ of their nation/homeland because of its lag in progress compared with the city.

I don&rsquo;t know whether these were the farewell tears for our last Colonial Governor, Chris Patten, or for the touching moment of the handover. I say this because of a very funny story that Mama just told me.<br></br>",

Of course, even our God is crying for our Governor. We will miss him. Ah...What will be Hong&nbsp;Kong like under the Chinese Communist Party?….” Another woman interrupted, “What ails you? What&rsquo;s wrong with the restoration of the sovereignty by our motherland? I feel good…..” They insisted on their own views and kept on arguing.<br></br>",

                    "This is a momentous and historic day : July first, nineteen ninety-seven. After one hundred and fifty-six years of separation, Hong Kong and China are whole again. This is a solemn, stately, and proud moment. We are here today to announce to the world, in our language, that Hong Kong has entered a new era.<br></br>",
                    "In recent history, China, as a nation, and we, as a people, have been through days of glory and times of despair. We have lived through days of hope, prosperity and glory. We have lived through days of despair, humiliation and hopelessness. The lesson is clear : the most precious possession of any nation or any people is the ability to chart one&rsquo;s own future, to be master of one&rsquo;s own destiny. Indeed, over the past century and a half, many compatriots, driven by lofty ideals and steadfast conviction, have devoted themselves to the advancement of our people and safeguarding the territorial integrity of our nation. Their enormous sacrifice and tireless efforts have brought us to where we are today. Never have we, as a nation, had such prosperity and potential to achieve greatness as we do today. Nor have we achieved greater recognition and dignity in the international community as we do today; as Hong Kong is finally re-united with China in a smooth and peaceful manner.<br></br>",
                    "Today, we, as a nation, are fortunate to be in a position which our predecessors could only dream about. As a Chinese living in Hong Kong, and on behalf of all the people of Hong Kong, I would like to express our profound respect and gratitude to all the men and women who have made such sacrifices and given us what would otherwise have been impossible to attain.<br></br>",
                    "The resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong under &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo; is an ingenious and novel concept. The eyes of the world are on us, as Hong Kong accepts the great honour, and the challenge, of charting new waters which will make history. We are confident that we will rise to the challenge and build a brighter and better future. Our confidence is well founded. Our conviction is based on the intellect and vision of a great patriot and statesman; on the solemn commitment of a great nation; and on the wisdom, industry and versatility of the Hong Kong people, a legacy from our heritage and culture. Above all, we, as one nation and one people, will implement the &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo; concept; it is entirely within our prerogative to make it work.<br></br>",
                    "Through a solemn act of law, the Central People&rsquo;s Government has granted Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, unparalleled anywhere in the world. We value this empowerment, and we will exercise our powers prudently and responsibly. We are embarking on a new era. With the respect and trust from the entire nation, we will be that much more equipped to sail forward with confidence and with conviction. We will play a part in facilitating the re-unification of the entire nation, and bringing a better life to all in the nation.<br></br>",
                    "For the first time in history, we, the people of Hong Kong, will be master of our own destiny. The Special Administrative Region Government is fully committed to preserving the Hong Kong way of life, maintaining Hong Kong&rsquo;s free and open economic system, upholding the rule of law, and building a more democratic society. We will be compassionate to those in need, and we will maintain Hong Kong as a vibrant and international city.<br></br>",

As I stand here at this historic moment, a moment of great honour and pride, I am mindful of the enormous responsibilities which lie ahead. Throughout my life, I have experienced the joy and satisfaction of success and the pain and frustration of failure. I understand the hopes and aspirations of Hong Kong people. I am fully aware of the power in unity of purpose and direction. I will resolutely uphold the principles of autonomy as set forth under the Basic Law. I will carry out my duties with honesty, sincerity and determination. I will lead the 6.5 million people of Hong Kong, along with our indomitable spirit, towards the future. As part of China, we will move forward as one inseparable nation with two distinct systems.<br></br>",

In an intriguing and provocative exploration of its cinema, architecture, photography, and literature, Ackbar Abbas considers what Hong&nbsp;Kong, with its unique relations to decolonization and disappearance, can teach us about the future of both the colonial city and the global city.<br></br>",
                    "The culture of Hong&nbsp;Kong encompasses Jackie Chan and John Woo, British colonial architecture and postmodern skyscrapers. Ironically, it was not until they were faced with the imposition of Mainland power—with the signing of the Sino-British Joint Agreement in 1984—that the denizens of the colony began the search for a Hong&nbsp;Kong identity. According to Abbas, Hong&nbsp;Kong’s peculiar lack of identity is due to its status as “not so much a place as a space of transit,” whose residents think of themselves as transients and migrants on their way from China to somewhere else."

Not confined to one place, Lau travels wherever Chinese communities can be found. The focus is always on the soon-to-disappear trails of life, grand or trivial: one-room homes, private living quarters, kitchens, cluttered surroundings, wall hangings, objects on shelves and in refrigerators; details reflecting living conditions, political and religious beliefs (or the lack thereof), dreams and aspirations, ancestry and identity, traditions and new values. His subjects’ postures and expressive gazes often suggest the state of their complex psyche as they strive to survive in the new world. “The Year of the Handover” was captured in the weeks approaching July 1, 1997 as Hongkongers’ anxieties rose to new heights. Although continued freedom and prosperity were promised, the 50-year assurance did not put folks at ease. Before capturing their portraits, Lau would often ask how his subjects felt about the handover, to which the typical answer was, “You already know how I feel, why do you even bother to ask?!”. Lau recalls:<em>“When facing my camera, their expressions were blank. Look at Hong Kong now.”</em>",

The government refused to acquiesce to demands for a “white bill” (that is, a version with draft provisions that can be amended before the actual legislative process, while the later version, known as the “blue bill,” is the actual draft legislation submitted to the legislature for passage) and instead laid out general principles in a consultation paper that most critics complained was inadequate for serious analysis and discussion. The government then compiled and categorized opinions as in favor, against or unclear, but its evaluation of public opinion submissions were widely viewed as disingenuous. The government reported that many of the most vocal opponents of the legislation, such as the Bar Association and the Hong&nbsp;Kong Human Rights Monitor, had submitted “unclear” opinions neither in favor nor against the Article 23 legislation."

                    "Since the onset of the Asian financial crisis, Hong&nbsp;Kong’s economy has faced an unfavorable external environment. Financial liquidity in Asia drained away in the crisis and its aftermath. Hong&nbsp;Kong’s link to the U.S. dollar through a currency board arrangement did not improve matters. The Hong&nbsp;Kong dollar appreciated in value along with the strengthening U.S. dollar during 1999–2002. Investment demand for housing collapsed at the same time that the housing supply began to soar. Although nominal mortgage interest rates were kept low in a globally low-interest-rate envi- ronment, the true borrowing cost was high in real terms, with deoation plodding along at 2–4 percent per year (table 3). Households were struggling to pay down their mortgage debts after the housing-market bubble burst. Domestic consumption was shrinking, and the economy was contracting. Hong&nbsp;Kong’s unemployment rate hit record levels, exceeding 7 percent by the end of 2002. The unemployment problem was made worse by the continuous inoow of low-skilled immigrants from mainland China.<br></br>",
                    "Beginning in 2003, signs of economic recovery had appeared. Real GDP in Hong&nbsp;Kong grew at 3.4 percent in 2002:Q3 and at 5.1 percent in 2002:Q4. In late spring of 2003, exports from China picked up very strongly, and cargo movement in Hong&nbsp;Kong ports and airports showed good growth. Thus, the outbreak of SARS hit Hong&nbsp;Kong at a very bad time. Domestic demand collapsed before it had an oppor- tunity to recover from the recession in 2001. Alarmed by the outbreak at the Amoy Gardens and by the news that several foreign businessmen might have contracted SARS in Hong&nbsp;Kong and returned with it to their home countries, WHO issued a travel advisory on 2 April 2003, urging people to postpone nonessential trips to Hong&nbsp;Kong and Guangdong. WHO’s travel warning and the reluctance to travel by air devastated travel and tourism in the Asian region, particularly in Hong&nbsp;Kong. Many companies worldwide banned business travel to infected areas. Restrictions on travelers from infected areas aggravated the situation.<br></br>",
                    "As the SARS outbreak raged on in China, the economic environment in the region darkened as the prospects of the fastest-growing economy in Asia became cloudy. The uncertain outlook prompted the World Bank to predict that output growth in East Asia would fall by almost 1 percentage point in 2003, to 5 percent (World Bank 2003). Analysts and rating agencies also revised their forecasts downward (table 4). On average, private sector analysts estimated that Hong&nbsp;Kong’s output growth in 2003 would be 1.2 percentage points lower than previously expected, which trans- lated to a drop of around HK$15 billion in spending on anal goods and services in the domestic economy. On 9 April 2003, the government announced that the original forecast of a 3 percent real growth rate in GDP would not be met. Doom and gloom hit the region and Hong&nbsp;Kong (pg. 67-68).<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "The SARS outbreak was an unexpected negative shock to Hong&nbsp;Kong’s economy. The most signiacant negative effects were on the demand side. Local consumption and the export of services related to tourism and air travel were severely affected in the short run. Early anecdotal evidence reported in the press indicated that restau- rants and retail outlets were hit hard, with sales dropping by 10 to 50 percent. Land transport declined by 10–20 percent because people stayed home. There was also a 50 percent drop in the use of the Airport Express Line,1 which indi- cated a reduction in air travel. Fortunately, the supply side of Hong&nbsp;Kong’s econ- omy was unaffected. Even though SARS raged through the province of Guangdong, the cross-border manufacturing base was not disrupted. The production and cross- border movement of goods continued to function smoothly, and the global supply chains remained intact (pg. 70).<br></br>"

After reunification, Shanghai threatened to become China’s new financial capital, and people in Hong&nbsp;Kong worried that they would soon be living in “just another Chinese city”; its real-estate markets began a precipitous decline, and restrictions on civil liberties threatened its nominal sovereignty. sars felt like a knockout blow to a city already reeling.<br></br>",

When sars broke out, we couldn’t work from home—the Internet wasn’t good enough. Instead, we watched from our offices as the green-and-white-roofed Star Ferry boats travelled, empty, across Victoria Harbor. Each afternoon, we waited for the Hong&nbsp;Kong Department of Health to release its numbers. We kept a betting pool, guessing how many new cases there would be. The idea was to get close but not go over; an optimist, I always lowballed.<br></br>",

After a prankster falsely suggested that the city was going to be sealed off, some A.T.M.s briefly ran out of cash. Then, as if things couldn’t get any worse, on the first of April, Leslie Cheung, the openly bisexual Cantopop crooner and actor who had starred in “Happy Together” and “Farewell My Concubine,” leapt from the twenty-fourth floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Cheung had always felt like a lucky charm for Hong&nbsp;Kong—a beloved and approachable celebrity we could see drinking in Lan Kwai Fong on any given night. Cheung’s death—he had suffered from depression—darkened our already dour moods.<br></br>",
                    "We didn’t know it yet, but that week—the week of Leslie Cheung’s death—was the point of maximum hysteria and fear. In early April, while we were betting on the number of new cases and wondering about the extent of the coverup, Hong&nbsp;Kong passed its inflection point, with the number of new infections sinking below that of cleared cases. As April turned to May, and warmer days commenced, we looked around and realized that we were still alive.<br></br>"

Whilst initially insistent on the National Security Bill&rsquo;s passage as scheduled, the Hong&nbsp;Kong goverment changed its course when on 7 July 2003 the traditionally pro-government Liberal Party chairman James Tien resigned his membership of the Executive Council consultation and supported calls for further consultation. As it realised that without the support of the Liberal Party the National Security Bill would no longer generate sufficient votes for passage, the government was forced to withdraw it. Plans for the enactment of Article 23 legislation have since been shelved indefinitely."

Whilst massive human rights violations in Hong&nbsp;Kong under Chinese (communist) rule which Hong&nbsp;Kong during the 1990s feared have not materialised after 1997, the autonomy as has repeatedly been promised to the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong by the British and Chinese governments as well  as in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and ultimately the Basic Law of Hong&nbsp;Kong, promulgated by China’s National People’s Congress in 1990 as the prospective mini-constitution of post-colonial Hong&nbsp;Kong, has nonetheless been eroded. The erosion of autonomy has particularly been caused by and manifested in the existence and use of the mechanism laid down in Article 158 of the Basic Law of Hong&nbsp;Kong which vests the power of interpretation of the Basic Law of Hong&nbsp;Kong ultimately in the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, a legislative body of China. Universal suffrage, the cornerstone and ultimate indication of every developed society, continues to be denied the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong, even though it was explicitly promised by the Joint Declaration and which the Basic Law of Hong&nbsp;Kong reiterates as the ultimate aim of governance of Hong&nbsp;Kong."

                    "The people’s congress is responsible to the people and is under the supervision of the people. Through universal democratic elections, it produces the people’s own representa- tives. The people’s congress effectively ensures that people of all ethnic groups in China have democratic elections, democratic decisions, democratic management and democratic supervision, and that they enjoy extensive democracy, freedom and rights under the con- stitution and the law. (Hu Jintao, 15 September 2004)<br></br>",
                    "In this short segment, President Hu mentions ‘democracy’ no less than six times, thereby highlighting the importance of this concept for his audience and for the occasion. It is almost tantamount to a declaration of principle, a constitutive docu- ment defining the liabilities and responsibilities of the People’s Congress. However, what is really meant by ‘democracy’ is not explicitly spelled out here. To discover the real meaning (in practice) of the concept, one has to go to another passage in the same speech by Hu Jintao:<br></br>",
                    "We must promote democracy and ensure that the people are the masters. To have the Chinese Communist Party in power is to lead, to support and to ensure that the people become the masters, to safeguard and to realize the fundamental interests of the majority of the people ... [to ensure this] we must strengthen the party’s governing ability. (Hu Jintao, 15 September 2004)<br></br>",
                    "In other words, to vary an often quoted, but probably apocryphal quip by Lenin, ‘democracy is good, but control is better’. In the Chinese vision of democracy, one can only allow for ‘democratic’ procedures as long as they are guided and kept in check by the real governing instance, the ‘locus’ of power, the Party. Clearly, there is a lack of harmony between the two concepts: ‘freedom’, as ensured by democracy and democratic procedures, and ‘power’, as instituted by, and embodied in, a minority of people who have the obligation to ‘lead’ the people to become ‘masters’ – but of what? The people can only exercise their ‘mastership’ under the guidance of, and in subservience to, the views and dictates of the Party, which itself is controlled by a small number of people in the Central Committee (not even by the 1400 members of the People’s Congress, which itself is under the control of the Party). It is a bit as if one were in a mirror cabinet, where the pictures are reflected, and reflect themselves, everywhere and infinitely, such that it is impossible to localize the ‘original’ and ‘leading’ picture, the one that is the mother and origin of the rest.<br></br>"

                    "[...] I am a researcher into the rule of law in Hong&nbsp;Kong and I am interested in how it can be maintained. I find that the situation of the rule of law is deteriorating and one of the reasons for that is we don’t have a democratic electoral system to put it on a solid foundation. The rule of law is not just judicial independence – yes, this is important and many people emphasis this – but how to ensure judicial independence? You must have sufficient limits on the powers of the executive branch before you can have a good protection of this. And without democratic election the kind of protection will be weaker. As the Hong&nbsp;Kong situation deteriorates in terms of the rule of law we have to find a way to increase these protections. This is why we must have a democratic election. I am not saying that we don’t have a rule of law at the moment – we do – but how to protect it has become the central question when we are under a whole number of challenges. So we need to have a democratic system to sustain the rights that we have properly.<br></br>",
                    "The second thing to say on this is about my own advocacy of civil disobedience, because some people have questioned this on the grounds: how can a law professor tell people to breach the law? This poses questions of what we mean by the rule of law, about the ideal of the rule of law, and what we are struggling for today. This is what Hong&nbsp;Kong people have not understood in the past: the mistaken idea that if you are planning civil disobedience – and therefore planning to breach the law – then you are somehow going against the rule of law. And this is something that the anti-Occupy Central campaign has developed as one of their main points. But the rule of law should not be literally understood as ‘obeying what the law says’. It is rather about whether you have a system of law that can achieve justice, including the political rights and freedoms of the people. So sometimes under certain conditions it is right to breach the law to help us achieve justice. That is the whole spirit of civil disobedience. Other people talking about that may not attract much attention but because I teach law here, at the University of Hong&nbsp;Kong, and am considered to be an expert on the rule of law in Hong&nbsp;Kong, these arguments have been raised over my role in Occupy Central. And this creates an interesting level of theoretical and practical argument within the movement."

With a pragmatic and accommodating approach adopted by all of us, the 2010 constitutional development proposals were passed by more than two-thirds of all Members of the LegCo, obtained the consent of the CE, and received the approval or record by the NPCSC respectively, and the &ldquo;Five-step Process&rdquo; was historically completed.<br></br>",

According to the 2007 NPCSC Decision, the selection of the CE by universal suffrage is a pre-condition for the election of all Members of the LegCo by universal suffrage. We need all Members here, people across the political spectrum, as well as various sectors of the community to work together to forge consensus.

The Hong&nbsp;Kong community has become highly divided and polarized, especially during the months preceding the NPCSC’s 31 August 2014 decision concerning the process for nominating CE candidates. At one end of the spectrum, the conservatives wanted to keep the Election Committee from the previous CE election cycles as the nomination committee for the 2017 election and even raise the threshold for nomination (which had been well below half of the committee in previous cycles). At the other end of the spectrum, many people have no confidence in the Election Committee model. So they advocated civic nomina- tion, that is, a person who has secured a certain amount of popular endorsement from the voters becoming a candidate. Another proposal was to have nomination by political parties that will have secured a certain percentage of votes in the LegCo election in 2016.<br></br>",

By contrast, Hong&nbsp;Kong people see “One Country, Two Systems” as a guarantee of their high degree of autonomy, according to which they could run local affairs without intervention from Beijing – including the election of their Chief Executives."

                    "Lines had now been drawn. In the White Paper, Beijing had declared itself the boss, with little said about putting hearts at ease. The Joint Declaration’s twelve articles had become twelve preexisting Chinese principles that “come solely from the authorization of the central leadership,” with little said about the international legal commitments that the Declaration entails.11 As if to clear up any doubt about Beijing’s stance, Chinese diplomats and Foreign Ministry officials would before the end of 2014 begin openly claiming that the 1997 handover had completely fulfilled the Joint Declaration and thereby rendered it “void.”12. Such claims, of course, fly in the face of clear language in the Joint Declaration’s Article 7 that obligates both parties to implement all articles of the agreement. By undercutting the Joint Declaration, Beijing emphasized the NPC Standing Committee’s full authority to interpret or amend the Basic Law as it chooses. It would subsequently use such authority to interpret “universal suffrage” in its own idiosyncratic way.<br></br>",
                    "The White Paper calls the view that takes Hong&nbsp;Kong’s high degree of autonomy seriously “confused or lopsided.” A “high degree of autonomy” is said not to be “full autonomy”; the central government’s “comprehensive jurisdiction” over Hong&nbsp;Kong is likened to its direct control over other local administrative regions; and the NPC Standing Committee is credited with not only “comprehensive jurisdiction” but also the power of “supervision” over local legislation.13 The White Paper paradoxically identifies the NPC Standing Committee as the guardian of Hong&nbsp;Kong’s rule of law, with Hong&nbsp;Kong judges described as administrative or governing officials charged with upholding national security. The decidedly unrepresentative Election Committee is described as “an expression of equal representation and broad representativeness.” The White Paper even says that the chief executive must be a person “who loves the country and loves Hong&nbsp;Kong,” a phrase that is seen in Hong&nbsp;Kong as code for “must be a figure in tune with the pro-Beijing establishment.”"

                    "A different kind of war over words has raged in recent months in Hong&nbsp;Kong. It is not an ethnolinguistic war over ‘pure’ dialects, or a war over English or Chinese medium-of-instruction policies, but a semantic war about words. Who can decide what words mean when opposing sides in a conflict apparently attach completely different meanings to the same concepts? In accordance with the framework laid out in the Basic Law, Hong&nbsp;Kong’s mini-constitution, the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong are supposed to elect the Chief Executive in 2017 through universal suffrage. However, when the current government presented their proposed framework for political reform, a war over words broke out in the media, and later in the streets of Hong&nbsp;Kong. The Hong&nbsp;Kong government, aided by mainland government officials, claimed that the people of Hong&nbsp;Kong would be given a unique opportunity to elect their own leader through a fair and impartial one-person-one vote electoral system. The pro-democracy camp and various student organizations, on the other hand, claimed that the government’s political reform proposal had nothing to do with democracy, because it ruled out civil nomination and because only pre-approved candidates who had to be patriotic and ‘love the country’ [PRC] could run for Chief Executive.<br></br>",

Therefore, when words mean different things to different people, they both create and sustain different versions of ‘reality’, and we shall argue that these competing versions are at the core of the problem in the debates about democracy and universal suffrage in Hong&nbsp;Kong.<br></br>",

                    "In June 2014, the PRC State Council released a White Paper on the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ policy in Hong&nbsp;Kong. The paper outlined some of the overarching principles that should govern the political reform process in Hong&nbsp;Kong. One requirement, mentioned repeatedly, is that the people who govern Hong&nbsp;Kong must be patriotic: ‘Loving the country [PRC] is the basic political requirement for Hong&nbsp;Kong’s administrators’ (including the Chief Executive, government officials, members of the Executive and Legislative Council, and judges). This requirement was strongly criticized by particularly the judiciary in Hong&nbsp;Kong, which proclaimed their independence from the gov- ernment in public statements. The White Paper also stipulates that Hong&nbsp;Kong must work, with Mainland China, to build a common home for all Chinese; it thereby reinforces the ‘One-Country, One-People, One-Language’ ideology, which has been promoted by the Chinese government since the 1950s (Wang & Ladegaard 2008). A final contentious issue is that government officials “have on their shoulders the responsibility of correctly understanding ... the Basic Law”. In a response paper, the Hong&nbsp;Kong Bar Association points out that the courts in Hong&nbsp;Kong campaign neither can nor will take instructions from anyone as to a definitive ‘correct’ interpretation of the Basic Law."

They may not agree with Occupy Central but they think universal suffrage should be supported. So they agree with the goal of the movement, but they disagree with the means, i.e. civil disobedience. But this middle group will not join with the anti-Occupy Central campaign, because they have no demands on the meaning of universal suffrage. So they think we are wrong to occupy the central area, but want to see a substantial form of universal suffrage. We have therefore three sides. We must find a way to reach a consensus in the whole of society so that we can proceed to the future constitutional development."

                    "*792,808 Hong&nbsp;Kong people had cast ballots in the Civil Referendum held by Occupy Central with Love and Peace from 20 to 29 June. It showed that Hong&nbsp;Kong citizens are not afraid of suppression and treasure their freedom of expression. We are very encouraged by the result and would like to express our gratitude to the citizens for their support to Occupy Central with Love and Peace and their trust in the online voting portal established by the Public Opinion Programme of The University of Hong&nbsp;Kong (POP) and Centre for Social Policy Studies at the Hong&nbsp;Kong Polytechnic University (CSPS).<br></br>",
                    "In this civil referendum, there were two motions for the citizens to express their views. The first motion is about what electoral reform proposal Occupy Central with Love and Peace should submit to the government. Proposal no. 1, namely the Alliance for True Democracy proposal, was elected by 42% of the voters, received 333,962 votes. Excluding the abstentions and not voted, people who voted for this proposal constitute 46% of the valid votes.<br></br>",
                    "The three proposals on the ballot have altogether received support of 720,284 votes, constituting 91% of the total number of votes. This reflects a strong support of the citizens for proposals with the element of civil nomination, and the government has to respond to the public’s demand. On the other hand, we notice that 72,397 people chose to abstain or not to vote, which constituted 9% of the total votes. The result reflected that certain voters might not fully understand the proposals or did not support them.<br></br>",
                    "Regarding the former, Occupy Central with Love and Peace will continue to do our best to explain the proposals to the community. Regarding the latter, we will, with a humble and open attitude, communicate and seek cooperation with all the organizations and individuals who advocate for the democratization of the Nominating Committee. Together we will continue to fight for a genuine universal suffrage.<br></br>",
                    "The result of the second motion in the civil referendum is clear and unequivocal.  696,092 citizens (87.8% of the total voters) believed that if the government proposal does not meet international standards allowing genuine choices by electors, the Legislative Council should veto it. 59,897 votes said that LegCo should not veto it, constituting 7.6% of the total. There were 36,487 votes of abstention and not voted, constituting 4.6% of the total.<br></br>",
                    "The result indicates that although Hong&nbsp;Kong people may have diverse views on the electoral reform proposals, they have a clear bottom line – other than one person, one vote, universal suffrage should allow people from different backgrounds to enter into the election thus providing truly meaningful choices for the voters. Those who claim that even a non-genuine universal suffrage should be “accepted temporarily” have been defeated by the poll results."

                    "Meanwhile, two documents put out by Hong&nbsp;Kong’s local government officially started the democratic-reform process. The first summarized five months of consultations regarding electoral reform. The second was the HKSAR chief executive’s report to the NPC Standing Committee on the need for reform.14 Together, these papers put forward the misleading claim that “mainstream opinion” (or “relatively more views”) favored the outcomes that Beijing had called for (and would later require) on issues such as the patriotism of the chief executive and the Nominating Committee’s makeup, procedures, and powers. Scrutiny later revealed that more than nine-tenths of the material conveyed in the consultation report consisted of en bloc submissions by elements aligned with the government.15 In January 2015 came first a report on the Umbrella Movement protests and then the launch of the second round of democratic-reform consultations. Nowhere has there been any attempt to correct the earlier misrepresentations of Hong&nbsp;Kong opinion or to address public concerns in a serious way.<br></br>",
                    "The NPC Standing Committee embraced the chief executive’s report. Instead of the straight approval or disapproval specified in the 2004 interpretation, the Standing Committee imposed severe restrictions along with its approval.17 A requirement to mod- el the Nominating Committee on the Election Committee ensured that nominations will remain in the hands of unrepresentative and establishment-favoring elites. A 50 percent (as opposed to a 12.5 percent) threshold for nomination guaranteed that democratically minded candidates (known locally as “pan-democrats” to signify that they come from a range of parties and groups) would have no chance of getting through the door. As if to nail this down, there was also a requirement that the number of those nominated to be chief executive cannot exceed three. Like the White Paper, the decision worries about sovereignty and security, and stresses that the chief executive must love “the country” (that is, China) and Hong&nbsp;Kong.",

At the end of August, the NPCSC decided that the composition, the number of members and the method of formation of the nomination committee for 2017 will be the same as (and not just designed with reference to) the Election Committee in 2012, and each candidate will need the endorsement of over 50% of the members of the nomination committee, which is much higher than the 12.5% that was adopted for nomination in the previous Election Committee.<br></br>",
                    "This NPCSC decision is more conservative than the community had expected. Not only does it exclude any possibility that a candidate favoured by the pan-democrats will be successfully nominated, it also leaves little room for the middle ground options that had been discussed in Hong&nbsp;Kong during 2013 and earlier in 2014. The NPCSC decision leaves the pan-democrats with limited choices: either use their representation in LegCo to vote down the electoral legislation that the Hong&nbsp;Kong government would introduce to implement the NPCSC decision (something the pan-democrats could do if they stuck together because the legislation will need a two-thirds majority in LegCo to pass the proposal for constitutional reform), or take the issue to the streets."

                    "Much of the debate about ‘democracy’ is reminiscent of how the term was used in the former Eastern block of Europe. In the Soviet Union, much was made of the notion of ‘democratic centralism’, as defined by Lenin, and realized in the ‘people’s democracies’ popping up everywhere following the end of WWII in the East of Europe and several places overseas – one wonders if this is the kind of ‘democratic’ model that Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping are thinking of, when they say they are pursuing a Chinese type democracy?<br></br>",
                    "Centralism’, even if called ‘democratic’, implies control: things have to be organized by, and in accordance with the views of, the ‘center’ (read: the powers that be). Furthermore, such control can be either direct or indirect; in the latter case, one has to be sure that the people on the intermediate levels are behaving ‘correctly’: control has to be extended downwards, so that even the popular vote becomes representative of the center’s viewpoints. Accordingly, the Hong&nbsp;Kong 2017 Chief Executive election, even when based on the ‘universal suffrage’ enshrined in the Basic Law of the SAR, is not envisioned in the same way by the central government and by the pro- democracy opposition, the people supporting Occupy. The difference, and the resulting divergent interpretations of ‘democracy’, turn around the question whose interpretation is the more correct one; in practice, this boils down to questioning the degree to which the elections are controlled by the PRC Central Government. <br></br>",
                    "Doesn’t then President Xi’s claim, cited above, imply that a ‘democracy’ of the aforementioned Chinese type has to be imposed wherever the Chinese control the situation, irrespective of the wishes and claims of the people they control? (The case of Tibet is an egregious example).<br></br>",
                    "But why can’t the Mainland Chinese see this, when it is so patently obvious to millions of their compatriots in Hong&nbsp;Kong? One (perhaps the main) reason is that the very Constitution of the PRC has, in its Article 3, the words: “The state organs of the People’s Republic of China apply the principle of democratic centralism” (italics in original); and, according to Lenin, this principle is realized as “freedom of discussion, but unity in action” (Lenin 1901/1902). But what is this freedom worth, if the only action that is allowed is the one controlled by the ‘center’? The principle has been inculcated in the minds of several generations of Mainland Chinese, and this may explain their failing ‘(in)sight’.<br></br>"

Umbrellas, an everyday object that Hongkongers are accustomed to carrying around because of the wet subtropical weather, took on a new meaning. The so-called Umbrella Movement brought Hong&nbsp;Kong to a virtual standstill: Harcourt Road became a patchwork of tents, umbrellas, and reading nooks, even including a library. Protesters swept the road, took turns teaching one another in makeshift classrooms, and pooled resources for food and water. Newspaper estimates put the number of protesters crammed onto this downtown thoroughfare at more than 100,000 at any given time. Causeway Bay and Mongkok had similar campsites, each a distinct mix of personalities and ages, united by a shared dream of genuine democracy. Protesters conjured a massive display of peaceful disobedience, cleaning the streets and sharing resources as the days wore on. I was 16 when the Umbrella Movement broke out, but Brian Leung was a second-year student at the University of Hong&nbsp;Kong. “You saw a lot of your peers — like Nathan Law — become the leading figures of a city-wide movement,” he recounts. “It was spectacular.” This built a very strong sense of community among Hong&nbsp;Kong’s young people, many of whom were previously apolitical. And, as Brian explains, the resilience and togetherness witnessed in those autumn months built “a very strong collective memory” among democrats in Hong&nbsp;Kong’s society"

                    "The key leaders and supporters of Occupy have similarly refrained from likening the protests to a revolution. Joshua Wong, leader of Scholarism, a high-school students’ group that has played a key role in the democracy movement, said at an October 4 rally: “We are not seeking revolution. We just want democracy.” Lester Shum, the deputy head of the Hong&nbsp;Kong Federation of Students, said: “This is not a color revolution”—the term widely applied to movements that led to the overthrow of three governments in the former Soviet Union in the early 2000s. A group of academics has issued a separate statement insisting that the protests are not a revolution.<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "Beijing has adopted the term “revolution” to paint the protesters as extreme, and Western media in their haste to brand the movement have embraced the same term. But the idea of revolution had never even occurred to many ordinary citizens of Hong&nbsp;Kong. Nor did the protesters have any intention of toppling the government as a whole, or remaking Hong&nbsp;Kong’s relationship with China, when they chanted the slogan “Leung Chun-ying step down.”<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "The Chinese Communist Party’s leaders seem to view the pro-democracy protests as an act of defiance, if not rebellion. By branding them as a revolt, they are anxious to send a clear warning to Hong&nbsp;Kong’s people: Don’t play with fire. But calling Hong&nbsp;Kong’s pro-democracy movement a revolution risks misreading the nature of the protests. Worse, the language of revolution obscures the real democratic aspirations of Hong&nbsp;Kong’s people, prolonging political restlessness in the city and exacerbating the perennial strains in mainland-Hong&nbsp;Kong relations."

                    "Throughout this paper, I have posited that the history of the Umbrella Movement is an international history that formed the identities of youth in Hong Kong. Two forms of nationalism have intersected in the development of a national identity of the Hong Kong people, owing itself to international contexts. Youth have then built their own political movements which have become accepted through outlets such as the Victoria Park Vigil. These new political movements have cemented themselves through grassroots support, yet the medium they use to communicate their message actually ended up splintering localism as a movement. The days leading up to September 27th, 2014 saw conflict between a pan-Democratic movement and localist movements that further fractured the Umbrella Movement’s legitimacy. The world saw tear gas sprayed onto a sea of umbrellas, but that moment in contemporary history is still not over. The rise of groups such as Hong Kong Indigenous, and events such as the “Fishball Revolution,”[53] highlight the power of youth identity in Hong Kong in shaping a new nationalism. Hong Kong is not a passive city, and its values are rooted in a history of identity contestation."

Instead, it was guided by a new generation of pro-democracy advocates born in the threshold of the 1997 handover, who had “no memories of a British Hong&nbsp;Kong and no attachment to mainland China”. With the emergence of a new generation of advocates, the pro-democracy movement’s spirit was evolving, from its non-confrontational beginnings into a more disruptive resistance embodied by the new Umbrella Movement."

That is, people only cared for their livelihoods, and their common dream was to achieve economic success. The driving spirit which has long made HK people proud of themselves is built on hardship endurance, self-reliance, and an attitude of being hard working. The HK tycoon Li Ka- shing, for instance, has long been youths’ admired and emulated figure. It is said that the Umbrella Movement is a turnaround and testifies an awakening of HK youths’ social and political consciousness.<br></br>",

They urged students to withdraw from the occupied areas for the sake of their own safety and to now end the occupation at a timely point. One convincing argument from these sympathizers is that withdrawal at this point could gain a greater acknowledgement from the HK general public and avoid a massive physical suppression from the authority in view of how the 1989 movement ended."

In cultural terms, China has drifted more towards Hong&nbsp;Kong than the other way around. Hong&nbsp;Kongers feel more assured, more self-confident. [...] The younger generation of Hong&nbsp;Kongers, born in the city, has discovered the remnants of a collective memory. They criticise the older generation for having allowed it to be liquidated. When, at the beginning of 2007, the government destroyed the Star Ferry in order to build a highway, their adamant opposition triggered a fundamental debate about the future. Picked up on by the press, the debate has captured the interest of the authorities, who have begun to realise that, in order to construct its future, a society must preserve its collective memory, history and common experience; for these are the things that give people a sense of stability, security and belonging, these are the things that define identity."

Second, the student federation leaders who took part in the dialogue are not free agents either. They represent only one of the student groups, and other actors are involved.

It underestimated Beijing’s resolve and instead has insisted on the impossible, that Beijing withdraw the August 31st decision.

The Umbrella Movement came and went without compelling any concessions partly because the Hong&nbsp;Kong government was recalcitrant, but also partly because protesters stuck to an inherently unsustainable form of protest. It is true that the disruptive action of occupying busy streets captured the world’s attention. Yet after the initial show of people power on September 28 and 29, most demonstrators were un- ready to stay for the long haul. The most committed camped out in the streets, and the less committed had to make a living. The uncommitted gradually lost their patience, and the antagonistic grew more hostile. Had police and thug violence not repeatedly roused enough public anger to drive supporters back to the occupy sites, the Umbrella Movement would have folded sooner than it did."

So unlike previous protests in Hong&nbsp;Kong that affected the economy, the lack of an even marginal effect on the economy was the main reason that the 2014 protest didn’t succeed.

Furthermore, as expressed by several commentators, the fact that the movement was almost totally unbloody and mostly non-violent compared to what had happened some 20 years earlier in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, inspires hopes that some things did change, and that (as some local and foreign newspapers have expressed it), “Hong&nbsp;Kong will never be the same after Occupy.”"

                    "As extraterritorial crimes are not punishable under the Hong&nbsp;Kong law, the only way to bring the suspect to justice would be to have him extradited to Taiwan to face criminal proceedings where the crime was committed. With no extradition agreement between Taiwan and Hong&nbsp;Kong, there was virtually no hope for Chan to stand trial in Taiwan. Moreover, under Hong&nbsp;Kong’s existing extradition law, Hong&nbsp;Kong can only exercise its China-blessed limited power to enter into extradition agreements with jurisdictions “other than the Central People’s Government or the government of any other part of the People’s Republic of China.” As a result, no extradition agreement can be entered into with China under Hong&nbsp;Kong’s existing law. That preclusion is regarded as a firewall shielding Hong&nbsp;Kongers from the jurisdiction of China. Of more pertinence to the murder case in Taipei is that the firewall provision also precludes the Hong&nbsp;Kong government from entering into any arrangement that would bring Chan to justice in Taiwan — unless Taiwan is considered a jurisdiction outside China"

The juridical assistance network has been expanding through the signing of agreements with increased jurisdictions, with a view to combating crimes and upholding justice. According to the relevant provisions in the Basic Law, Hong&nbsp;Kong may, through assistance or authorization of the Central People’s Government (CPG), maintain juridical relations and make appropriate arrangements with other jurisdictions for reciprocal juridical assistance. The Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (“MLAO”) (Cap.525 of the Laws of Hong&nbsp;Kong) and the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (“FOO”) (Cap.503 of the Laws of Hong&nbsp;Kong) provide legal basis for cooperation between Hong&nbsp;Kong and other places on MLA and SFO. The two ordinances, effective since 1997, aim at enabling Hong&nbsp;Kong and other places to cooperate in combating serious crimes, pursuing judicial justice in criminal cases and preventing criminals from absconding to elude justice. So far, Hong&nbsp;Kong has signed MLA agreements with 32 jurisdictions and SFO agreements with 20 jurisdictions.<br></br>",
                    "The above two ordinances have been in force for 21 years, during which there have been a number of serious crime cases in which the culprits have absconded to other jurisdictions to elude justice. A case in point is a homicide case that caused extensive public concern last year. In this case, a Hong&nbsp;Kong resident suspected of murdering another Hong&nbsp;Kong resident in Taiwan has returned to Hong&nbsp;Kong, but the request for sending him to Taiwan for trial cannot be processed due to the limitations of MLAO and FOO (both ordinances stipulate that they are not applicable to any other parts of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”)). As a result, the court of Hong&nbsp;Kong could only handle the suspected money laundering offences committed by the suspect in Hong&nbsp;Kong, leading to widespread public concern. Apart from the victim’s family who was grief-stricken and wrote repeatedly to and met with HKSARG officials expressing grave concerns about injustice caused by the system’s loopholes, there have also been doubts in the community against the Government’s commitment to combating serious cross-boundary crimes. Having thoroughly reviewed MLAO an FOO, the Government considers that the two ordinances must be amended promptly to plug their loopholes and to protect public safety."

The existing arrangement does not leave a loophole, but rather erects a necessary firewall to ensure that Hong&nbsp;Kong’s judicial independence remains intact. I was foreign secretary in the run-up to the handover: negotiators from both China and the UK made a conscious decision to create a clear divide between the two systems so that the rule of law remains robust. You can verify this by looking at archival documents in the National Archives (for example, FCO 40/3774; FCO 40/3775; FCO 40/2595)."

In an interview with local television on Wednesday, she became teary-eyed while talking about the personal sacrifices she had made to serve as chief executive.

Protestors believed that the Hong&nbsp;Kong government was using the murder case as a facade to pass amendments that would allow Beijing to extradite vocal dissidents to face trial in China. Since the historic protests in 2003, Beijing has continued to influence new legislation to silence pro-democracy activists, dissidents, and protestors, who they deem to be a growing threat to the stability of China."

                    "HONG KONG — Protesters poured into the streets of Hong&nbsp;Kong on Sunday with renewed determination and a lengthening list of demands, rejecting the government’s retreat on a contentious extradition bill and extending the political crisis gripping the semiautonomous territory.<br></br>",
                    "Hong&nbsp;Kong’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, shelved the bill on Saturday and followed that up with a rare apology the next day, actions that pro-democracy activists dismissed as too little, too late.<br></br>",

And yes, black has long been worn as a signal of opposition in Hong&nbsp;Kong, including in the protests against attempts by the Chinese government to introduce a new “moral and national education” plan in 2012 and by the pro-democracy marchers of 2017.<br></br>",

                    "As for the international community’s support, Fong stated that since she was studying at an international university, many foreign students were eager and curious to learn more about the protests, as they didn’t know the roots of the culture and the political environment of Hong&nbsp;Kong."

In about four days, you will have been in our lives for six months now. It’s really been a wonderful and happy time for us both. Mom’s maternity leave ends on Friday, so we won’t all be at home all day with you anymore. But it was really nice while it lasted. Of course we will spend the rest of our lives together as a family, but these six months being with you nearly every moment has been really special and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.<br></br>",
                    "Right now, it’s 3 a.m. and I’m sitting on a footbridge that connects the Hong&nbsp;Kong legislative council building to an office building. It offers a great vantage for the protests that are starting and will continue over the next few days against an impending extradition bill that would allow the mainland Chinese government courts to compel the HK courts to send people in Hong&nbsp;Kong to China to be prosecuted. Of course, it doesn’t sound like a really big deal on the surface, but it would allow courts in China (which are not transparent and do not follow a clear rule of law) to persecute people here for political reasons. So for example, if one day you are in Hong&nbsp;Kong and decide to exercise your right to express your political opinions, a court in China could come up with a reason (valid or not) to have you tried there, and the HK government would then be expected to deliver you to that court. This type of agreement erodes the autonomy of Hong&nbsp;Kong, which is supposed to be a completely separate political system until 2047.<br></br>",
                    "By then, you will be 28 years old, and I’m afraid there might not be as many rights available to you as there are to Hong&nbsp;Kongers at present. You may not be able to have a say in your government, speak freely about whatever you want, or be able to practise whatever you religion you like. Right now, the mainland Chinese government is rounding up religious practitioners and ethnic minorities such as Muslims, Uyghurs, and Christians and putting them in concentration camps. We don’t know what might happen in the future, but we remember what happened in the past and can see what’s happening right now. So that’s why I’m here, when I’d rather be at home with your mother in bed, ready to wake up at a moment’s notice and go to your room in case I hear you wake up and cry.<br></br>",
                    "Of course, we are so much luckier than most people in Hong&nbsp;Kong. Although you were born here in a very nice, clean, and safe hospital (practically for free!), you are already an Australian citizen, and we will be registering you with the US consulate tomorrow morning for your first US passport and social security number. You have a lot of options. One day you might live in America, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, or anywhere else you might want to go if you have the desire and the talent to make it happen. By the time you read this letter, maybe we will already be living somewhere else. Maybe even in China! So if things ever get bad here in Hong&nbsp;Kong, we will be safe and can be with our family elsewhere. This is not an option for most people in Hong&nbsp;Kong. So while I want you to be able to live here in the future if you want, I think it would be disingenuous to say that I’m here, on this footbridge, for you. Your mother, and definitely your grandparents, all think that the best thing I could do for you, my beautiful son, is to stay at home. And maybe they’re right. It’s hard to ever be sure about these kinds of things because all sides might have a valid point.<br></br>",
                    "I have to admit that before I left the house tonight to walk to Admiralty, I went into your room to look at you asleep in your crib and tell you that I love you. Maybe that’s a little melodramatic, especially because just last week I left you and your mother at home to go to a bar to watch Liverpool win the Champions League final, but I am a bit scared too. The last time I came to a protest like this was 5 years ago, about six months after your mother and I first met. It was October, right before the beginning of the Umbrella Movement. I had originally come by just to support my students who were protesting for their right to true universal suffrage. I didn’t really think it was my fight per se because I’m not from Hong&nbsp;Kong. I spent most of my time there taking pictures, cleaning up garbage and sorting out the recycling. Then it got really crowded and I ended up getting teargassed by the police. It was very scary, totally unexpected. I ran away when I saw the smoke and heard the explosion of the tear gas canister, but the next thing I knew, I was on the ground unable to breathe. My eyes stung and my skin felt like it was on fire. Luckily, there were some well prepared volunteer medics on the scene who poured water over me. They were so heroic. I was and am so grateful to them.<br></br>",
                    "I remember walking through Tamar Park afterwards and seeing kids crying in shock. I was soaking wet and not in the best condition myself. I felt so defeated, and I felt so bad as I walked away and the protesters there watched me. I could sense their disappointed understanding that I had had enough. I went back to your mom’s place to take a shower, and everything smelled like pepper. I distinctly remember the straps on my backpack smelling acidic too. The images of kids being tear gassed was all over the news. I don’t know if I have ever felt as hopeless as that moment.<br></br>",
                    "The next morning, I woke up to go to campus but all the roads were empty. No cars or buses at all. I was confused and went online to find out what was going on. Only then did I find out that after we had gotten tear gassed, thousands and thousands of Hong&nbsp;Kong people took to the streets to protest the unnecessary violence. They ended up occupying major thoroughfares throughout Hong&nbsp;Kong—hence the absence of any traffic on the road. These occupations became a full-on political movement, and it brought the city to a standstill. And for a few months at least, the impossible seemed possible.<br></br>",
                    "The next few months were so beautiful. Your mother and I were falling more and more deeply in love, and we witnessed something miraculous with the Umbrella Movement. It was like seeing a meadow in full bloom, a spontaneous orchestra of sounds in sync to a new song that would only ever be heard once. And it was the first time I ever felt like I was at home—being a part of something bigger than myself with people who wanted me there and to whom I could contribute something meaningful. Of course it couldn’t last forever. But beauty is by definition fleeting.<br></br>",
                    "So, that’s why I’m here (don’t worry though, this time I’m hanging out near the news camera crews: good views and less likely to get gassed!), even though I’d rather be home with you. Because I’m grateful for what Hong&nbsp;Kong has given to us. We are a family because of Hong&nbsp;Kong and its people. I don’t know what the future holds for us or Hong&nbsp;Kong. Maybe our fates are intertwined, or perhaps Hong&nbsp;Kong will one day be just a distant memory to you—the place where your parents met and you were born but only seen in photos and heard about in stories. But at least now you know that you were born from something beautiful and that I wanted to fight for its memory while we still could.",

                    "The first two weekends of protest, June 9 and 16, transformed Hong&nbsp;Kong forever. Hennessy Road, the six-lane thoroughfare that stretches across Hong&nbsp;Kong Island, was packed. Car-space became people-space as crowds flooded the streets, filling sidewalks, overhead pedestrian bridges, and alleyways with an ocean of black T-shirts and dark hair. Here, in a city where space comes at a premium, a “sea of black” — as characterized by so many — was created. The images that emerged from these marches captured an intensity of energy and a sense of togetherness that was born in the tight corridors of space winding around high rises. Two million voices coming together as one."

                    "I walked from the pier to Nathan Road, the main thoroughfare in the area, where I met my friend Benny, a reporter for Nikkei Markets, who was standing in front of a convenience store in a gray T-shirt and denim shorts. He gave me a hug and a rainbow-colored umbrella from 7-Eleven—a protester favorite because it has a hard metal tip for self-defense. I hadn’t seen Benny since I’d moved to Beijing two years ago, but we had only a few minutes to catch up before a battalion of police officers down the street hoisted a black flag, signaling tear gas, and fired the first round.<br></br>",
                    "“Move!” Benny said, pulling me onto the sidewalk. Swiftly, seamlessly, and by some collective instinct, the crowd parted, making way for a line of younger protesters. Snaking down the length of Nathan Road in single file, they formed a human supply chain in order to transfer resources—umbrellas, masks, saline—from one end of a demonstration to another. A protester at the far end of the chain began to flap his hands above his head, imitating a sparrow, which prompted others down the line to copy the motion. This was one of the hand signals that activists had developed to aid communication, Benny explained. Drawing circles around the cheeks was a request for a face mask, peace signs were pliers, and sparrow hands were helmets. Seconds after the message was delivered, a yellow hard hat floated down the chain like a buoy.<br></br>",
                    "The human chain epitomized the strategy of the protests: “Be water,” a phrase from Bruce Lee’s martial arts philosophy that encourages resilience in the face of obstacles. Whereas the Umbrella Movement of 2014 stubbornly occupied the city’s streets and landmarks, today’s protesters have adopted guerrilla tactics. When resources are needed, a human chain materializes quickly. When the police advance, it dissipates, reappearing elsewhere. Logistical information is shared through Telegram, an encrypted messaging app; posters and leaflets are distributed using the iPhone AirDrop function, which leaves no digital trace; and real-time updates are crowd-sourced on HKmap.live, a mapping tool that can be marked up with icons: a dog for police, a dinosaur for special tactical squads, a white speech bubble for tear gas.<br></br>",
                    "Unlike the Umbrella Movement, whose organizers were aggressively persecuted, these protests are anonymous and leaderless. There are no figureheads to target and imprison. Decisions are made through an egalitarian and chaotic process of digital democracy, often through a voting mechanism on the online forum LIHKG, Hong&nbsp;Kong’s version of Reddit. Someone floats an idea; it gains traction; and a group of people come together to implement it. The official protest anthem, “Glory to Hong&nbsp;Kong”—now blasted daily on speakers, sung by choruses in malls, and played by street accordionists—was created in this manner. A local pop-rock musician who goes by the pseudonym “Thomas dgx yhl” posted a version of the score, inspired by both “The Star-Spangled Banner” and Vivaldi, on LIHKG, then developed the lyrics from the feedback he received.<br></br>",
                    "Responsibilities in the movement are shared widely, allowing for broad participation across diverse sectors of society. Everyone chooses a role to play. I noticed that many of the younger protesters—kids no older than thirteen—stood near the back of the chain, supporting their older, more physically capable counterparts on the front lines. Volunteer medics in bright-yellow vests roved the streets with first-aid kits to treat the injured. Restaurant owners opened their doors to those seeking food and safety. Behind the scenes, lawyers offered their services pro bono; graphic designers created and distributed artwork; and drivers transported people to safety."

Late in the day, a large group of demonstrators from the mostly leaderless movement broke off and faced off against riot police at Hong&nbsp;Kong’s Legislative Council building. Eventually, they smashed their way into the building and swarmed inside, damaging fixtures and equipment, tearing down portraits, spray-painting slogans and graffiti, and occupying the building for a short time. Police eventually responded with force, and protesters vacated the building. The development is a new chapter in the history of Hong&nbsp;Kong protesters’ defiance toward China, and authorities in Beijing wasted no time in condemning the “serious illegal acts” that they said might lead to a breakdown in the social order."

                    "On the evening of 21 July 2019, during the 2019–2020 Hong&nbsp;Kong protests, a mob attack occurred in Yuen Long, a town in the New Territories. An armed mob of triad members dressed in white indiscriminately attacked civilians on streets with steel rods and rattan canes, before attacking passengers in nearby Yuen Long station including the elderly, children, black-clad protesters, journalists and lawmakers. At least 45 people were injured in the incident, including a pregnant woman. The attack happened following an anti-extradition bill protest earlier that day in Sheung Wan, a district on Hong&nbsp;Kong Island.<br></br>",
                    "Despite thousands of reports to the 999 emergency hotline, the police only arrived 39 minutes after the attacks and one minute after the mob had left the station. The police stood idle at a nearby police station and no arrests were made that night. The police force&rsquo;s inaction, as well as mounting evidence of corruption and misconduct by the Hong&nbsp;Kong police, led some citizens to accuse the police of collusion with the mob, failing in their duty to protect the public.<br></br>",
                    "In Hong&nbsp;Kong it has been named the 721 incident, after the date of 21 July."

                    "But Article 14 also states that the Hong&nbsp;Kong government may ask for “assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief.” With a chief executive chosen by a 1,200-person selection committee that generally defers to Beijing, the central government in China can easily direct the local government to request PLA assistance.<br></br>",

Hong&nbsp;Kong people, with access to resources and their own creativity, outdo themselves. A similar banner will appear on the face of Lion Rock.

Dressed in improvised armour—hard hats, goggles, masks, cellophane and umbrellas—they prepare to face riot police. Makeshift barriers, bricks and bottles meet with police tear gas—more than 1,800 canisters and counting—and rubber bullets. Hand signals and Telegram groups round out their arsenal.<br></br>",
                    "The earnestness of many protesters is seen in their actions. While destroying symbols of oppression in the Legislative Council chambers, protesters leave coins to pay for cans of soda. A bespectacled teenager places a traffic cone over a tear gas canister, before dousing it with water. It is a battle between many Davids against the giant Goliath, with kids using homemade tools. <br></br>",
                    "“Be Water” is to today’s protesters what Cui Jian’s “Nothing to My Name” was to the activists of 1989. It is, however, more hopeful and perhaps more effective. Faced with overwhelming power, protesters must adapt to any situation.<br></br>",

                    "Not only young protesters improvise. As in Beijing, where art students sculpted the Goddess of Democracy and medical students treated hunger strikers, in Hong&nbsp;Kong, people from all walks of life participate and apply their trades when possible. A Cathay Pacific pilot introduces his passengers on a Tokyo-to-Hong&nbsp;Kong flight to the peaceful protest at the airport, as well as the now ubiquitous chant, “Hongkongers, add oil!” Lawyers, civil servants, airport personnel, medical staff, teachers and accountants all come out to protest, just like the many segments of society that demonstrated in China.  <br></br>",
                    "People leave fare cards and coins at MTR turnstiles so protesters can ride without having to pay or be identified. Thirty years ago, students from all over China travelled for free to join the demonstrations in Beijing. Indeed, many of the protests are orchestrated by the young, as were those in Tiananmen Square. In the Hong&nbsp;Kong protests, everyone is assigned a task, and litter is collected afterwards. However, unlike 1989 and the Umbrella Movement of five years ago, no one is in charge, though unity is a guiding principle. "

Soft-liners such as the Neo Democrats have organised protests to urge reform of the Basic Law and for Hong&nbsp;Kong people to come first in the allocation of resources. Hard-liners such as Hong&nbsp;Kong Indigenous and Civic Passion have agreed to adopt violent clashes with the authorities and mainlanders. They also see claiming independence is a way of forcing the Chinese government to give genuine universal suffrage to Hong&nbsp;Kong. Furthermore, some of them, such as the Hong&nbsp;Kong National Party, have advocated establishing a “Republic of Hong&nbsp;Kong” to take back sovereignty from China. <br></br>",

                    "To begin with, most traditional pan-democratic parties, especially the older members, have a strong Chinese identity while the localists only identify with Hong&nbsp;Kong. Based on their historical connection, the position of the traditional pan-democratic parties is perhaps representative of political sentiments toward China. In terms of “anti-China” explanations, the democrats claim that they are “patriotic” as they supported the reversion of Hong&nbsp;Kong’s sovereignty from Britain to China, and have a strong commitment to China’s political, social, and economic development. Many traditional democrats identify with “cultural, ethnic, and historic” China rather than the CCP regime.<br></br>",
                    "But localists have a strong identification with Hong&nbsp;Kong. Many of them take a more critical attitude towards mainlandisation and the Beijing government and emphasise that Hong&nbsp;Kong people are responsible for protecting the core values and interests of Hong&nbsp;Kong only. In the face of rising political intervention by China, they are sceptical of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle because it cannot eliminate control by Beijing and separate the mainland and Hong&nbsp;Kong. From the localist perspective, the Chinese government is attempting to invade Hong&nbsp;Kong and weaken Hong&nbsp;Kong’s identity. The makes localist claim that they are protecting local identity and showing hostility towards the Chinese government and mainlanders. They believe that Hong&nbsp;Kong people should resist intervention by China and social disruption by mainland visitors.<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "The rise of localism is a warning to the authorities because China-Hong&nbsp;Kong tensions remain unresolved and have even become more confronta- tional. Ironically, this sense of stronger resistance has resulted in a vicious cycle: Beijing steps up intervention in Hong&nbsp;Kong affairs while society develops stronger anti-China sentiment followed by localism. However, the HKSAR government has not taken any initiative to address the root of the problem, so Hong&nbsp;Kong can be expected to witness more intense clashes like the Mong Kok Riot. With Hong&nbsp;Kong people becoming more supportive of localism, the political gap between China and Hong&nbsp;Kong will widen. There are two possible ways to deal with this situation. On the one hand, the Chinese government could accommodate the dissatisfaction of Hong&nbsp;Kong people by heeding calls for constitutional reform, in particular the introduction of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive and Legislative Coun- cil elections, thus narrowing the gap. On the other hand, China could exercise more political intervention to force Hong&nbsp;Kong society closer to Chinese values. No matter which path is selected, it has to be acknowledged that China-Hong&nbsp;Kong relations have entered a new stage that prompts reflection on the future of Hong&nbsp;Kong after the “One Country, Two Systems” policy ends in 2047.<br></br>"

Its participants first mobilized around a single ask: that the local government withdraw an ill-conceived extradition bill that would have exposed Hong&nbsp;Kongers to China’s opaque legal system. When Hong&nbsp;Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam responded with a police crackdown, protesters cohered into a movement: They began to demand an investigation into police violence, that the government stop calling the protests “riots” (which exposes protesters to rioting charges, punishable by up to 10 years in prison), amnesty for detainees, and the free elections long promised by Beijing.<br></br>",

                    "The June-July Anti-Extradition Bill Protest Movement of 2019 has been led by young people — Young Hong Kong. It has challenged and overturned many of our preconceived notions. Previously, many pan-democracy activists clung to a range of views about just what was and was not possible, as well as what should and should not be done. All of that has been shown up as being meaningless. Now, Young Hong Kong has done many things that we previously had thought to be impossible, including using crowd funding to publish advertisements about the movement in the international media. And they have accomplished all of it without setting up large stages or podiums during the mass rallies; they have done it without identifiable leaders or at the behest of a political party. Regardless, they have been successful in mass mobilisation undertaken with seamless co-ordination; and, what’s more, they have done so without rancour, free of internal wrangling and with remarkable efficiency.<br></br>",
                    "They have also engaged in actions that the older generations regard as being beyond the pale, or that certainly would be seen as being be injurious to efforts to win over average Hong Kong residents. Then, on top of all of that, they have launched actions that everyone believed were off limits, such as surrounding Central Police Headquarters or storming the Legislative Council chambers. Yet, by their very nature and daring, the actions of Young Hong Kong have elicited sympathy and support from the majority of Hong Kong people. They have made people question the right of the government to respond to such overt challenges with violence. One oft-repeated slogan of the movement is eloquent in its simplicity:<br></br>",
                    "‘We are not violent rioters; you are a violent government’.<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "The two most important things that I have learned are:<br></br>",
                    "First, older people like me need to cast off the shackles of past experience. I need to realise that, even if one’s efforts may be doomed, by not acting you are simply giving in to failure; and,<br></br>",
                    "Secondly, I need to overcome my fears. Virtually all of the young people who launched that assault on LegCo, as well as those who got inside, said that they had been ‘terrified’. They were right to feel afraid, that’s because they were confronting a superior force that was armed to the teeth. They also knew that they were also facing a legal system the could well sentence them to anything from eight to ten years in prison for their actions. But being ‘terrified’ did not stop them from doing what they felt was right. The more social experience you have the harder it is to act.<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "I was unprepared for the dawning realisation that so many members of Young Hong Kong would not be intimidated despite the fear they felt; they were determined to ‘err on the side of freedom’. Their actions were a vivid expression of a sentiment that, in my own youth, I notionally supported even if I was never called upon to act on it. That is the credo: ‘Give me Liberty, or Give me death’. On the night of 1 July, tears of shame ran down my cheeks.<br></br>",
                    "People whose spirits are enslaved become inured to their benighted state; they crave personal wellbeing rather than daring to resist. Despite all of that, one Mainlander offered the following observation online:<br></br>",
                    "‘This generation of Hong Kong young people will be remembered by history. They are confronting an impossible situation and they are facing down a pitiless foe. They have endured the indifference both of the Mainland and of Taiwan, as well as that of the international community. Yet they have continued their lonely struggle regardless; theirs is a kind of courage that choses to be ‘like shattered jade rather than merely surviving as an undamaged adornment of coarser stuff’.<br></br>",
                    "‘Our reactions as Chinese to their acts of resistance are fraught with contradiction. No one doubts that the Communists want to transform the people of Hong Kong in such a fashion that they end up being just like any other group of commonplace Chinese. But the people of Hong Kong demonstrate that they would rather be defeated in clamorous and glorious struggle than herded like pliant swine. Each time they go into the streets to protest, the people of Hong Kong relentlessly humiliate every single Chinese person — all 1.4 billion of us.’<br></br>",
                    "While such a sentiment is worthy of serious reflection, it won’t necessarily inspire pride in Young Hong Kong: they know all too well that ultimate success is indeed far from being assured.<br></br>"

                    "For months throughout the summer, Hong Kong’s protesters held a dizzying array of demonstrations across the city, in what began as opposition to an extradition bill that would have allowed the city to send suspects to mainland China to face charges. Millions have attended traditional marches, sit-ins, and large rallies at parks. There have also been urban guerrilla-style battles with the police, a laser-beam rave party that doubled as a protest, and giant Lennon Walls plastered with Post-It notes across the city. The government finally withdrew the bill in early September, but to many, it’s too little, too late—a concession that should have come in June after millions marched peacefully, and before public anger coalesced around widespread allegations of police brutality. And so the protests continue.<br></br>",
                    "“The very nature of the movement has been described as leaderless, although I think rather it’s a leader-full movement” said Johnson Yeung, a human rights activist who was arrested for his participation in a protest in late July. “A decentralized, leader-full movement is resilient against an authoritarian regime,” he added. “When you have a leader-full movement it’s very hard to pick a target… the movement will survive because everyone will take ownership of the movement.”"

                  "Distinctly different from the Occupy Central protests of 2014, the people of “Generation HK” were at the forefront of the movement. Armed with a self-protective mentality, this upcoming generation was formed with neither the recollection of Hong&nbsp;Kong’s colonial past nor any loyalty towards China. This emerging identity was rooted in a new preconception of what it means to be a “Hongkonger”."

While victories have been rare, these movements have shaped the cycles of optimism and anguish that have been integral to the crystallization of the Hongkonger identity that emerged from this undemocratic yet open society. I am part of what Financial Times correspondent Benjamin Bland has labeled Generation HK in his book of the same title: the children raised to adulthood in the SAR, the babies born in the blurry threshold of pre-and-post 1997, the teenagers and 20-somethings who laid their lives on the line in the heat of 2019. With no memories of a British Hong&nbsp;Kong, and no attachment to China, mine is the generation that most adamantly regards itself as “Hongkongers”— a term added to the Oxford English Dictionary after the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement brought the city to a 79-day standstill in 2014.&rdquo;"

                    "The decision to withdraw the Bill is one of &ldquo;four actions&rdquo; announced by Mrs Lam today to foster dialogue that can help society move forward after more than two months of protests.<br></br>",

                    "The third action is to begin direct dialogue with the community this month.<br></br>",

Or whether it is better to sit down to find a way out through dialogue.<br></br>",

Increasingly, that has felt impossible. Sitting on the fault lines of two worlds, trying to weave together a kinder and more plural story with the messy threads of my own personal life, experience and biases, as two old dudes in suits — one with bright, orange hair and another jet black — threaten to rip the whole intricate stitching apart."

The Bill was read the First time at the Legislative Council meeting on 3 April. Then, I gave notice to the Legislative Council on 27 May that the Administration intended to resume the Second Reading debate on the Bill at the Legislative Council meeting on 12 June. <br></br>",
                    "Due to divided views on the Bill among the public and conflicts in society, the Administration has decided to suspend the amendment exercise after conducting a study and review. In this connection, I wrote to the President of the Legislative Council on 15 June to withdraw the notice of resumption of the Second Reading debate on the Bill. The work of the Legislative Council in regard to handling the Bill thus ceased. Since then, the Administration has repeatedly stated that the amendment exercise has stopped completely<br></br>",

Does the review include the Secretary&rsquo;s serious personal misconduct in handling the Bill, causing severe social unrest and division, for which he should tender apologies to the public, be held accountable and step down?<br></br>",

                    "But for others, particularly younger people in Hong&nbsp;Kong, frustration flared into anger. The more the Party tried to force Hong&nbsp;Kongers to buy into its narrative of a united, rising China, the more they rejected it. I saw the hot flashes of anger everywhere. At soccer games, people booed the national anthem that I had happily sung during the Beijing Olympics ten years earlier. They blamed soaring housing prices and unemployment on the influx of mainland immigrants, who were perceived as instruments of the Party’s effort to assimilate the local population and erase its culture. The rhetoric used to describe mainlanders became laced with the xenophobic undertones I associated with far-right nationalism. Speaking Putonghua with young people today, a local activist warned me, was like “waving the red flag in front of a bull.” Being a Hong&nbsp;Konger and being Chinese, once complementary, were now mutually exclusive."

                    "The first responses came within a few minutes and continued for days. Nearly two dozen people—frontline protesters, Hong&nbsp;Kongers living abroad, students—sent back messages detailing their thoughts. Some were succinct (“We are not Chinese,” one 40-year-old man wrote), while others sent lengthy paragraphs. One related his sadness that his young son would grow up to see a city fundamentally different from the one that he experienced; another said she thought Hong&nbsp;Kong’s films, which blend humor and traditional Chinese themes, best represented the territory; a man in his 20s talked about recently becoming enraptured with Hong&nbsp;Kong history and digging through old maps of the territory; some poked fun at the stereotypes of Hong&nbsp;Kong people as buttoned-up workaholics focused on money.<br></br>",

This demonstrator spoke of being deeply moved by protesters helping one another with supplies and organization over the past months: “How can you not love this place when you see people unselfishly helping each other?”"

Unveiled by Beijing overnight, and drafted without the involvement of the Hong Kong administration and public, the law came into effect immediately and was designed to suppress political dissent. Under the disguise of national security concerns, any statement—visible or subtle—against China could be considered an act of subversion, secession, terrorism, or colluding with foreign powers.",

Furthermore, this law would also allow for the possibility of Hong Kong people to be tried in China’s judicial system—known notoriously for human rights violations. Most alarmingly however, the scope of the National Security Law can extend beyond the jurisdiction of Hong Kong. Anyone expressing political support for Hong Kong’s independence could be at risk of breaching the law and becoming a target of China.",

                        "“Hong Kong identity isn’t just based on the rejection of Chinese identity, but a collective sense of resilience and autonomy and saying no to oppression,” Johnson Yeung, a veteran activist and former student leader who was arrested during a protest last month, told me. “Hong Kong people are putting up a fight to save their unique status.”<br></br>",

                        "The genesis of the Hong Kong identity as separate from the mainland can be traced in part to China’s internal developments, said Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies and the author of several history books on Hong Kong. Before Mao Zedong came to power in 1949, the border between Hong Kong and China was essentially open, and there was a free flow of people between the southern mainland and Hong Kong, Tsang told me. But once Mao took over, a border was enforced between Chinese Communist Party–controlled territory and Hong Kong, which remained a British colony until 1997, thereby creating a population that, as Tsang told me, “would grow up and expect to die in Hong Kong, which was not what happened before 1950.”",
                        "The coming decades produced the first generation of Hong Kong residents largely cut off from the mainland. As the city developed and incomes rose, the mainland languished. When China began to open up, people in Hong Kong “had a chance to go and see China at the tail end of Maoism,” Tsang said. “They crossed the border and really didn’t like what they saw. They went back to Hong Kong, and they realized that ‘yeah, we are kind of Chinese, but we are not that type of Chinese—we are Hong Kong–Chinese.’”<br></br>",
                        "In 1997, when Hong Kong was handed back to China, beginning a 50-year period when it would maintain its freedoms but be ruled by Beijing, there were high expectations among mainland authorities that “identification with the Chinese nation would slowly but surely strengthen among the local population,” Sebastian Veg, a historian at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris, wrote in a 2013 piece.",
                        "But, Veg cautioned, “the end of the resistance to colonialism may have paradoxically weakened the feeling of cultural belonging to the Chinese nation. Simultaneously, a new resistance to Beijing’s fixation on patriotism emerged. Most importantly, however, the new generation may be growing more aware of a contradiction between patriotic and democratic values.”<br></br>"

This generational shift towards a more uniquely Hong Kong-based identity has developed, Hui argued, as a response to what many younger Hong Kongers see as the erosion of the democratic guarantees made when the city was returned from British rule in 1997. “The proportion of people who see themselves as Hong Kong-Chinese has been going down and down. And people who see themselves as Hong Kong people, it's been going up and up and up,” Hui said."

                        "For decades, Hong Kong has been gripped by an unshakable sense of displacement: an untethering symptomatic of migration, but one without the physical movement this implies. A legacy of colonialism, of accepting a mass exodus of refugees fleeing Maoist destruction in China, of being a pawn in a tug of war between external powers, has condemned the city and its people to this feeling. Hong Kong has fumbled blindly in this confusion because her people are again and again asked to pick a discrete identity: Chinese or British, local or foreign.<br></br>",
                        "These are binaries, however, that Hongkongers do not, and cannot, fall within.<br></br>",
                        "In the 36 years since the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed, the SAR has seen a series of peaks and troughs in mass political mobilisation, with people using the streets as their stage for protest. While not all of these protests have been victories, they have been integral to the crystallization of the Hongkonger identity. Shaped by events, sharpened by the passions of resistance, and formed when the fundamentals of our identity are threatened, it is the sense that being from Hong Kong is different to the ethnic Chineseness it implies.<br></br>",
                        "According to Edward Said’s Orientalism, the dichotomy of East and West cannot coexist because they will always be the foil to one another. They are not mutually exclusive, because they construct one another. Hong Kong has long stood at this crossroads between “Western neoliberal globalism and China’s statist authoritarian capitalism,” according to Wilfred Chan in a Dissent Magazine article. But, he argues, despite the international attention on the SAR, Hong Kong is stranded between these disparate hegemonies. “For today’s Hong Kongers, there are no obvious escape routes, no postcolonial models of self-determination, that would set the city free from the grip of Chinese state power,” writes Chan. The undying love Hongkongers express for their home stands in contrast to the narrative pro-Beijing officials try to spin about them: that these “rioters,” brainwashed by the West, are bent on tearing down Hong Kong. To the SAR’s supporters in democracies abroad, Hong Kong is a symbol of the global fight against Chinese authoritarianism.<br></br>",
                        "“Being Hong Konger and being Chinese, long complementary, suddenly came to feel exclusive,” wrote New York Times journalist Max Fischer. A poll by the University of Hong Kong in June found that 75 percent of Hong Kong’s 18- to 29-year-olds identified as “Hongkonger” (not “Chinese,” “Chinese in Hong Kong,” or “Hong Konger in China”). Triggered by this year’s loss of freedoms — assembly, thought, movement, expression, safety — it was the highest proportion since identity tracking began in 1997. 52.9 percent of all respondents agreed, an increase from 35.9 percent at the time of the handover. But “Hong Kong’s identity isn’t just based on the rejection of Chinese identity, but on a collective sense of resilience and autonomy and saying no to oppression,” activist Johnson Yeung told The Atlantic. As the values that make Hong Kong distinct from China came under threat, being from Hong Kong came to stand in opposition to being from the mainland. Local scholar Brian C.H. Fong labeled this strengthening identity as the emergence of “one country, two nationalisms” — a reference to the “one country, two systems” guiding principle for rule in the SAR.<br></br>",
                        "And so, in the Hong Kong of 2019, we saw, for the first time, a total revolution: a city digging its heels in, its people raging vehemently against the erosion of freedom and democracy, values that separate Hong Kong from China. The city “[reassembled] an identity out of the refractions and discontinuities” of the present moment, as Said writes in Reflections on Exile. And the more the government fumbles, the more Beijing tries to shape Hong Kong after its vision, the more this place will rally to author the future.<br></br>",
                        "With this assertion of identity, young Hongkongers proved willing to give everything up. According to The Guardian, as of December 5th, 40 percent of the 5,980 arrested protesters were students. Among them, 939 were under the age of 18, with the youngest just 11 years old. In an interview for the same article, Hong Kong Education University sociology professor Stephen Chiu addressed the high-cost actions of the city’s youth, many of whom carry written wills when they go out to protest. As social stability continues to break down along with attacks on the Hongkonger identity, an impassioned resistance has replaced the sense of futility. “It’s a war situation,” said Chiu. “They are willing to die for their homeland. There are many examples in history. Whether you agree or not, there is a higher call and the protesters have a set of values some feel [is] worth dying for.”<br></br>",
                        "The extradition bill was therefore a uniting force. While the Five Demands of the protesters very clearly delineate the immediate aims of the revolution, this fight is now propelled by the sense that the essence of Hong Kong’s existence is being forcibly ripped away. Hongkongers are trying to save their unique status in the world. We are afraid of Hong Kong being subsumed into mainland China, of it one day becoming indistinguishable from the cities across the border."

                        "One of the key reasons why Hong Kong’s protesters have been able to coordinate at such scale and duration is their sense of collective identity, said Samson Yuen, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who studies local social movements.<br></br>",
                        "There was a gradual growth of opposition towards the extradition bill, he explained, starting with smaller-scale demonstrations in March and April and hundreds of petitions against the legislation in May, before escalating to marches of historic scale in June. “That’s why it’s so resilient: It’s simply because of the slow buildup of the collective identity” from a diverse set of participants, said Yuen. “It’s not simply Hong Kong identity we’re talking about here,” he added. “It’s more people’s everyday life identity,” such as one’s profession and neighborhood, that become strong markers of self.That culture of protest and civic participation has actually been building up over the course of decades. Since 1989, large crowds have gathered in Victoria Park every year to remember the Tiananmen Square massacre. Every July 1 since 1997, crowds have marched to demand greater democracy; a march in 2003 marked something of a watershed as half a million people protested a national security law.<br></br>",
                        "While that sense of collective identity is critical, the ongoing protests have also succeeded by amplifying individual actions. Brian Leung was one of a number of protesters who stormed the city’s legislature in early July, and was the only one to unmask himself in the chamber. He has since fled Hong Kong, but gave a speech via video link in August to an audience at a mass rally in the city. Reflecting on the protest movement so far, he identified one key takeaway: ”An important lesson is that social forces are intricately interconnected as networks. Each node of social force brings about new possibilities of further mobilization and new challenges to the regime,” he said.<br></br>",
                        "The interwoven web is much like the distributed leadership structure of the protests: Each person is an intersection, and each of those vertices strengthens the overall integrity of the structure. The government can arrest dozens of protesters at a time, snipping threads in the web, but the whole thing doesn’t come crashing down because other connections prop it up. That’s resilience."

                        "In the past, Chan and Chong have attended the annual candle-lit vigil in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, the only commemoration of the massacre permitted on Chinese soil. “I never thought that writing about the incident could become prohibited in Hong Kong,” Chong said. “But, in the last few days, the possibility is verging closer and closer to a probability.” To both the playwright and the director, this shift in narrative is significant, and the documentation of it even more so. With the latest proposed security legislation, if you dare to question Beijing’s version, you are liable to be accused of subversion. But to Chong and Chan the real fear is not knowing where the line might lie, and the danger, as a result, is policing one’s own imagination. Neither has much interest in promulgating a particular political ideology. “It is in the nature of art to be boundary-less,” Chong said. “But, if parameters are set on what I can think on the page and the stage, then the project of creation itself becomes futile, because you are a captive inside your head. Fear is the end point. It annihilates everything that came before and after.” As Chong spoke, she bounced her eight-month-old daughter on her lap. “I’ve already been an immigrant once,” she said. “My parents came to Hong Kong with so many fears but also hopes of making a better life here. Now that I have made this place my home, is it my fate to be always uprooted from home?”<br></br>",
                        "Chan said that the experience of watching men and women his age dying to defend their vision of patriotism, in Tiananmen, led him to discover an attachment he had not known that he felt to his birthplace. He said, “I knew I was neither mainlander Chinese nor British, but what did it mean to call Hong Kong my home?” The question had been both an inspiration and a source of anxiety. Hong Kong’s story has never been straightforward, Chan said. And the fact that he could play some part in its telling felt like a privilege and a testament to the city’s vibrancy.

                        "In february, a tweet by an Imperial College London professor went viral after he recounted how an ethnically Chinese teenager deflected racist COVID-19 remarks in Italy. “There you go, we are all going to be infected,” a passenger said as the teen boarded a train. The boy responded in Italian: “Ma’am, in my whole life I’ve seen China only on Google Maps.” People on the train applauded. In the retweets from those of Chinese descent, I noticed a certain air of pride, of winning. But who has won what, in the game of assimilation? Why did the teenager stress that he had never traveled to China, instead of pointing out the explicit racism of the passenger? Was he trying to reject a part of his identity?<br></br>",
                        "I wouldn’t have questioned his response when I was growing up. Only with some distance have I been able to reflect on the push and pull of my two worlds. After I graduated from university, I moved to Hong Kong for work and to connect with my roots. I made friends with other Hong Kongers who had grown up abroad and, for the first time in my life, began to accept my complicated upbringing. I read the poems of Sarah Howe and listened to the music of Emmy the Great, who are both British Chinese. In 2015, I worked for a year and a half in New York and joined communities that celebrated their American and Asian identities. Once I realized that my diaspora identity was complex—not definitive, but fluid—I also accepted my British side, this time on my own terms. These experiences away from the U.K. made me who I am today: someone who can embrace all aspects of her identity.<br></br>",
                        "Now when I look at the U.K., I feel frustrated that the British Chinese diaspora hasn’t come together as a community. We are less visible in activism and politics than our Asian American counterparts in the U.S. In the New Statesman in 2013, the writer Lu-Hai Liang noted that “young grassroots activism among second generation Chinese is still almost unheard of.” He followed up this year with an article discussing the rise in Sinophobia, noting that British Chinese “are now asking themselves about their place in British life and why it has been low-profile for so long.” Tweeting in July, the parliamentary candidate Johnny Luk urged “the British Chinese to confront our identity, step up & not sit on the fence so much.”<br></br>",
                        "I believe people in the community don’t speak up as a group for many reasons, including a deep-rooted fear of social exclusion and learned helplessness. Although it may be unacceptable for public figures to be openly racist—the Duke of Edinburgh’s 1986 remarks on the “slitty eyed” Chinese might be contended with now—racist aggression still occurs regularly. The Metropolitan Police reported 267 hate crimes against British East Asians—including violent assault, robbery, and verbal abuse—in the first three months of 2020 alone, compared with 375 in all of 2019. These crimes have mostly been greeted with silence. I have seen no large-scale protests; even the fairly prominent COVID-19 Anti-Racism Group, which distributed a petition calling for the government to investigate these hate crimes, hasn’t managed to secure more than 5,000 signatures after four months. And while Asians have had to struggle with a rise in Sinophobia everywhere since the outbreak of COVID-19, the difference in the U.K. is that the country presents itself as a long-term partner of Hong Kong, opening its borders to political refugees while doing little to make them feel welcome once they arrive."

Many also struggle to reconcile their memories of the territory with the seismic shift that has seen weekly confrontations with police ending in clouds of tear gas, fires, and vandalism. It is a battle mirrored in diaspora populations hailing from elsewhere: Elements of the Turkish diaspora in the United States are often blamed by Turkey’s leader for unrest back home; activists of Palestinian descent regularly organize protests around the world; and Cubans in Florida have long lobbied Congress on policy toward the island. Yet in the case of Hong Kong, the city’s diaspora often also comes into contact with a growing overseas population from mainland China, two communities that, while home to diverse views, are often in tension with each other.",

Since the recent demonstrations against the extradition bill heated up in June, Chan has been spending about five hours a day on campaigning. One June march in London, he said, drew as many as 4,000 people, who walked a mile from China’s embassy to the Hong Kong trade mission. (Some protests abroad have sparked conflict with pro-China counterdemonstrations, many of which have reportedly been orchestrated by Chinese diplomats.

                        "I’ve often found that in the most powerful stories that I’ve read —regardless of how subtle her gaze, how muted his voice, or how objective their persona — we can feel the presence of the storyteller. As a nonfiction writer, I am constantly questioning my presence in a narrative. Who I am in the story? (the curious outsider? the implicated bystander? the translator?) What is my relationship to the subject? (voyeuristic? collaborative? symbiotic?)  How am I implicated and what are my stakes?<br></br>",
                        "The question of persona becomes more confusing when it is conflicted, hyphenated — say, a Chinese storyteller telling stories for an English-speaking audience in a divided world. As a writer who has called Hong Kong, Beijing and New Haven home, I find myself often in the position of what Zadie Smith once called “speaking in tongues”: equivocating between the lens of the insider and the outsider, examining the places I call home with both the “objective,” parachuted gaze of the foreign correspondent, and the emotionally implicated and invested eye of the local storyteller. Increasingly, that has felt impossible. Sitting on the fault lines of two worlds, trying to weave together a kinder and more plural story with the messy threads of my own personal life, experience and biases, as two old dudes in suits — one with bright, orange hair and another jet black — threaten to rip the whole intricate stitching apart.<br></br>",

On her best day, she is praised for empathy and open-mindedness; on her worst, she is criticized for a lack of conviction and spinelessness. For those reasons, I often hesitate to insert myself in a story and seek to erase myself completely. The stakes are high and scary:  Are there immediate personal repercussions to publishing this story?  Will it enrich or detract from the story? Will it hurt when I reveal myself in this way?<br></br>",

                        "Nancy, like many of her generation in Hong Kong and Taiwan, had undergone a gradual and reluctant political awakening, spurred in part by the threat of Xi’s authoritarianism in the region. In these contested polities, on the edges of China’s empire, which had flourished outside Beijing’s direct control, young people came together to try to understand: How do you fight against Goliath’s denial of David’s very existence? For Nancy and her friends, this was existential. The challenge from China would determine the future of their countries and their lives.<br></br>",
                        "Ever since Nancy was little, she was a contrarian — unafraid to rebel against things she thought were stupid or unfair, like how teachers seemed to favor students who got good grades, even if they had been misbehaving along with the rest of the class. When she was growing up in Taipei, there were lots of things that just did not make sense to her. It did not quite add up that her schoolbooks said Taiwan was a province of the greater Republic of China (R.O.C.), which comprised mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, and that its capital was Nanjing. Nanjing was a city in the People’s Republic of China, where Nancy had never been, so why was it listed as the capital of her country? When she challenged her teacher, she told her to just do what everyone else was doing — write the correct answer and move on.<br></br>",
                        "Indeed, it was confusing. The R.O.C. is typically referred to internationally as Taiwan; it is by and large not recognized as a country and is instead referred to by many media organizations, including this one, as a “self-governing democracy.” But the archipelago, of which Taiwan is the biggest island, has a Constitution, a president and a Legislature. Its citizens have voted for their representatives in free and fair elections since 1992, the year before Nancy was born. They serve in their own armed forces and carry a green Republic of China passport when they travel, though in 2003, after they complained they were being confused with Communist China, the government changed the passport to say both “Republic of China” and “Taiwan.”<br></br>"

He missed Hong Kong often, the food, the city and his mother, whom he left there all alone without warning, not wanting to endanger her. In case the police questioned her, she could truthfully say she had no idea where he was. In his mind sometimes, he wandered the streets of Hong Kong and traced his favorite foods — milk tea from one shop, noodles from another, barbecue meat from somewhere else. A barrage of Hong Kong-flavored restaurants had been opened in Taipei by wealthier Hong Kongers who could afford to pay roughly $200,000 for an investment visa, but Gam thought their foods were pale replicas. Taiwan’s own milk tea was much weaker than Hong Kong’s. The closest he could find to anything resembling a familiar flavor was the egg tart at KFC.<br></br>",
                        "Many Hong Kong protesters had assumed they would feel culturally and linguistically comfortable in Taiwan, which often made the differences between the two places even more jarring. Hong Kong was serious, ruthless, efficient. Taiwan was hierarchical, subtle, ploddingly bureaucratic. In Hong Kong, Gam told Nancy, setting up a bank account took no time; in Taiwan, they waited a month.<br></br>",
                        "Gam was shocked by things Nancy considered totally normal. One day, they took 50 packages of merchandise to the post office. Beforehand, Gam had typed the shipping information into the website. But when they arrived, the staff had no idea what he was talking about. They asked them to hand-write the forms again. “Who does this by hand?” Gam exploded. “In Hong Kong, we will just scan a bar code, and it will take three minutes!”<br></br>",
                        "Many Hong Kongers shared Gam’s confusion. For them, coming to Taiwan had been a difficult decision and an even more difficult adjustment. Most aching was their sense of isolation — of not being able to trust the Taiwanese or even other Hong Kongers. They didn’t know what names they would be going by or who their friends would be. Many of them broke down when talking about their families, how they knew they could not be there when their grandparents or parents got sick or died. They found it difficult to relate to their Taiwanese peers, who had not lived with this trauma and who didn’t understand what it was like to really fight for your homeland. Nancy tried her best to provide the only thing she could: friendship.<br></br>"

After the encores, the last guitar note still reverberating, someone would yell the first half of the slogan, and others would answer in unison. At the end of December, I celebrated New Year’s Eve at a small pro-protest cafe where a friend played the unofficial protest anthem, “Glory to Hong Kong,” and everyone sang along.<br></br>",

That proposal was a sword that hung over us for nearly two decades, a threat to what Hong Kongers hold most dear — a culture of protest, the rule of law, freedom. We’ve been fighting for “freedom,” that abstract concept, for so long, with no idea of what losing it would look like. It was delivered with devastating speed — the whole process took less than two months — in the form of a 66-article piece of legislation that we had no say in. Hong Kongers, academics and overseas commentators say this is the endgame, that after this law, Hong Kong will be “dead.”<br></br>",

The subtext is that we might not have a place to love anymore.

Nine months earlier, when I posted similar images from Hong Kong, friends and colleagues here who had known the city as a gleaming, orderly metropolis expressed their shock. What compels a city to erupt? This, of course, is the question that I was sent to answer. I already knew the broad arc of the story. In 2019, Beijing had supported an extradition bill that would allow people in Hong Kong wanted on criminal charges in China to be taken to the mainland and detained there; the fear was that this could include people wanted on political, rather than legal, grounds. The bill might have been the trigger, but the size and the scale of the protests that ensued attested to increasing frustrations with Beijing’s encroachment on the city’s civil liberties, which have been protected by its semi-autonomous status. There are close to seven and a half million people in Hong Kong; at one point, almost two million of them joined the street marches. The protests began peacefully, but sometimes turned violent, and police brutality further inflamed the demonstrators. Nearly nine thousand people were arrested.<br></br>",
                        "There is no hope, more than one protester told me; Beijing will have its way. Eight months on, those words are proving prescient. On Saturday, Beijing revealed plans for a new security law that would grant it broader power over the territory, by overriding Hong Kong’s independent judiciary and establishing a national security office in the city. The law would give Beijing the authority to “exercise jurisdiction” over cases that “jeopardize national security under specific circumstances.”<br></br>",

                        "Watching the protests in New York, I’ve been compulsively pattern-matching them to the events in Hong Kong. Similarities aren’t hard to find, but my role is different now. In Hong Kong, I was an outsider: born in mainland China but reared in the United States, where a free press is constitutionally protected. Any storyteller chooses what information and details and sources to rely on, and my choices reflect my own culturally inflected values. Under President Xi Jinping, independent voices have been silenced in China, and the media has increasingly become an arm of the government, publishing news that serves the interest of the state. The irony is that the mainland media believes the same of Western reporters, denouncing them as government-sponsored shills selling propaganda to thwart China’s rise. My most memorable interview in Hong Kong was with a young man who had a different perspective. “On the one hand,” he told me, “I want you to report on what’s happening in Hong Kong, so that maybe the U.S. government can help us. On the other hand, I’m not really sure that that can be your responsibility.”<br></br>",

                        "After my story on Hong Kong came out, the official Chinese media called me a “pro-U.S. journalist who has made a career of smearing China.” Not that many people in China are likely to have seen my piece—The New Yorker’s Web site is blocked by the same digital wall that censors all press that does not conform to the Party line. I had an inkling that this might happen and realized, in retrospect, that my concern with projecting objectivity was born out of the anxiety that I could never prove my objectivity to my detractors. In an unfree society, even the pursuit of objectivity is a threat, because it suggests that there is a reality beyond the official state narrative."

                        "Over Hong Kong’s year of mass protests, certain moments rose above the din, some humorous and touching, others violent and disturbing. Few remain as traumatic as the attacks last year in the Yuen Long subway station. There, on the night of July 21, dozens of men in white shirts carrying rods and sticks, many of their faces obscured by masks, beat groups of commuters who scrambled for safety, cowering in train cars and piling into public restrooms in search of safety.<br></br>",
                        "The incident—referred to now in shorthand as “7.21”—remains an emotional milestone, one imbued with sadness and anger, not just because of the shocking scenes of violence, but the sluggish response by police. The alleged involvement by triads harkened back to a time when the city was less polished, where gangsters were emboldened and the police force was riddled with corruption. The belief that public places far from protest routes could serve as safe spaces was exposed as a naive illusion.<br></br>",
                        "Many Hong Kongers were outraged recently when the police began making arrests over the Yuen Long violence, picking up and charging not the attackers, but those who had been beaten, including a prodemocracy lawmaker left bloodied in the mayhem. Then, more than a year after the incident, officials presented an entirely new narrative of what occurred that night—recasting it as a pitched battle between two evenly matched sides, one of quick action by police in which the victims were actually the instigators.<br></br>",
                        "This new version of events marked the most blatant and audacious attempt yet at sweeping historical revisionism of last year’s protests. Hong Kong authorities appear eager to not just quash the demonstrations and move on, but create an alternate history of events in which prodemocracy protesters are the villains, bringing suffering on everyone else. It is not an uncommon tactic among autocratic regimes, wiping problematic episodes from the historical narrative, presenting the status quo as a moment that was never in doubt. The authorities in Hong Kong are going a step further, rewriting a movement that, although slowed, is very much ongoing, with hundreds arrested at protests on Sunday, when legislative elections were supposed to take place.<br></br>",
                        "[...]<br></br>",
                        "Hong Kong, a former colony that is administered as a special administrative region, has been an outlier in evading Beijing’s draconian controls over the flow of news and efforts to retool the collective memory. The anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, which China has sought to wipe from its history, is marked yearly in Hong Kong at a vigil that attracts hundreds of thousands of people. A museum dedicated to the event continues to operate. Hong Kong’s internet is also still free, and thousands of videos documenting the events of last year are easily available. Though interference in journalists’ work is increasing, it is still relatively limited. And the courts, which remain open to the media and observers, are beginning to hear protest-related cases. The narrative that the police and the government have put forward will come up, potentially “setting them up to be wrong again, which doesn’t seem to be the wisest choice,” Dapiran told me.<br></br>",
                        "Yet even if no one is convinced, the propaganda itself is the point, a show of the state’s ability to lie, and face no consequence. Haifeng Huang, an associate political-science professor at UC Merced, who is an expert on Chinese propaganda, wrote in a paper examining the issue that it “is often not used for indoctrination, but rather to signal the government’s strength in maintaining social control and political order.” Even so, Huang wrote in an email, if these efforts are “widely viewed as distorting truth, it may signal the authorities’ power but at the same time alienate citizens and worsen their attitudes toward the government.”"

                        "The law, a direct result of Lam’s introduction and mismanagement of a proposed extradition bill last year, which had led to mass demonstrations, was shrouded in secrecy. A draft had not been made public. Even pro-Beijing lawmakers and Lam herself had been kept in the dark about its full contents. She opened her remarks by saying that she wouldn’t be addressing the law, then moved on to speaking about an employment scheme and the city’s handling of COVID-19. When reporters pressed Lam on the law, she declined to say anything other than that commenting on the legislation would be inappropriate.<br></br>",

Free from more than 150 years of colonial rule, “for the first time in history,” Tung said, “we, the people of Hong Kong, will be master of our own destiny.”<br></br>",
                        "Yet in one of the most crucial moments in the city’s history, its leader was unaware of the contents of a far-reaching piece of legislation. She was shut out of the decision making, and incapable of answering any questions about the law. Her officials were also sidelined in the lawmaking process, and Hong Kongers’ concerns were ignored. With the adoption of this national-security law, it is a return to history for the territory: Colonized by the British, briefly and brutally occupied by the Japanese, never fully its own, once again overlords in a distant capital are making decisions on Hong Kong’s behalf. It could not be more clear how hollow Tung’s words now ring."

                        "On 30 June, China’s top legislature unanimously passed a new national security law for Hong Kong that entered into force in the territory the same day, just before midnight. The law is dangerously vague and broad: virtually anything could be deemed a threat to “national security&rdquo; under its provisions, and it can apply to anyone on the planet.<br></br>",
                        "The Chinese authorities forced the law through without any accountability or transparency: it was passed just weeks after it was first announced, bypassing Hong Kong’s local legislature, and the text was kept secret from the public and allegedly even the Hong Kong government until after it was enacted.<br></br>",
                        "Here are 10 reasons why everyone should be worried about this new law:<br></br>",
                        "Endangering national security” can mean virtually anything. Under this new law “secession”, “subversion”, “terrorism” and “collusion with foreign forces” incur maximum penalties of life imprisonment. But these offences are so broadly defined they can easily become catch-all offences used in politically motivated prosecutions with potentially heavy penalties.<br></br>",
                        "The United Nations human rights office and expert bodies have already repeatedly expressed concerns about the national security law, stating the broadly worded legislation can lead to “discriminatory or arbitrary interpretation and enforcement which could undermine human rights protection”.<br></br>",
                        "The central and Hong Kong governments have long accused individuals and civil society organizations of being steered by “foreign forces” in their activities, such as organizing and attending peaceful protests, receiving donations and criticizing the government. Anyone who participates in these activities is now potentially at risk of being charged for “colluding with foreign forces” and other new “crimes”.<br></br>",
                        "On the mainland, Amnesty International has documented the Chinese government’s routine use of “subversion” charges to jail journalists, lawyers, scholars and activists. In 2017, a court in China sentenced dissident Wu Gan to eight years’ imprisonment, citing his criticism against the government on the internet as proof of “subversion” of state power."

                        "The ruling is one of the most significant in Hong Kong’s recent history, criminalizing one of the most popular slogans from the pro-democracy protests that swept across the city in 2019. It sets a precedent that the mere uttering of any phrase or singing of any song that irks the government can now be deemed as among the most grievous of crimes in Hong Kong—a precedent that can, and most likely will, be used against the dozens of government critics sitting in the city’s jails, awaiting their day in court for allegedly violating the security law. The verdict “simply marks the end of free speech in Hong Kong, as a pure expression of politically dissenting opinion can be punished for inciting secession,” Eric Yan-ho Lai, the Hong Kong law fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, told me shortly after the verdict was announced. “Undoubtedly, the verdict aligns with the government narratives on the slogan and thus criminalized anti-government speech.”<br></br>",

                        "Much of Tong’s trial focused on the phrase “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,” which was used by the political activist Edward Leung during his 2016 campaign for a seat in the Hong Kong legislature. Leung, who was jailed in 2018, became a symbol for many young protesters during the 2019 demonstrations. He was hailed by his followers as having predicted Beijing’s crackdown and for advocating for more radical protest tactics. Prosecutors relied heavily on the expertise of Lau Chi-pang, a pro-Beijing history professor at Lingnan University, in Hong Kong, who drew on Chinese history to argue that the meaning of some words within the slogan had remained unchanged for more than 1,000 years and advocated for overthrowing the government. The defense called two professors; Francis Lee, of the journalism school at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who carried out research during the protests, said that the slogan could have numerous meanings. The three judges, however, wrote that this argument did not rule out that secession could be one of the meanings.<br></br>",
                        "Baggio Leung, a former pro-democracy lawmaker who helped create the slogan, told me it was hatched late at night during a brainstorming session on the balcony of Edward Leung’s office in January 2016. Edward’s original idea was too wordy and complicated for a campaign, so four young activists set about coming up with something snappier and less erudite that would catch people’s attention. Fueled by cigarettes and Chardonnay, Baggio said, the four settled on “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.” In 2019, as protests that began in opposition to a proposed extradition bill morphed into far larger calls for democracy and universal suffrage, the slogan became ubiquitous. It was chanted at demonstrations and printed on banners and stickers. Edward Leung’s image was stenciled onto streets and emblazoned on flags.<br></br>",
                        "Baggio Leung, who now lives in exile in the United States and is not related to Edward, told me he was amused by expert witnesses called by both the prosecution and defense, as well as lawyers attempting to dissect words thought up late at night by a group of friends. The slogan was meant to be eye-catching and had nothing to do with separating Hong Kong from China, he said. “They keep asking other people to interpret what it means, but to do this is meaningless,” Leung told me. “Everyone in their heart has their own understanding of it. Who are they to make a comment on how others think about this slogan?”"

                        "In the middle of a pandemic that has killed more than three hundred and fifty thousand people worldwide, what does it mean for a city to die? Last Friday morning, at the annual meeting of China’s National People’s Congress, the Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, put forward a national-security law that would ban “treason, secession, sedition, and subversion” in the semiautonomous city of Hong Kong. Under the law, Beijing has the authority to bypass the territory’s own parliament to crack down on any activity that it defines as threatening to its political legitimacy. Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, called the measure a “death knell.” On Twitter, journalists, pundits, and politicians made similar pronouncements. Lo Kin-hei, a leader of the Democratic Party, tweeted, “No matter how prepared we are to witness the death of our loved city, and no matter how many times it felt like it is dying, it still pains me to see another part of the remaining flesh is gone.” On Sunday, thousands of people, wearing protective masks, took to Hong Kong’s main thoroughfares in demonstrations similar to those that have convulsed the city since last year, when Beijing proposed an extradition bill that would have allowed people arrested in Hong Kong to be tried on the mainland. On Wednesday, protests erupted again, when the local legislature began debating a bill that would criminalize disrespect of the Chinese national anthem. Police in surgical masks fired repeated rounds of pepper pellets into the air and rounded up dozens of people, including schoolchildren.<br></br>",
                        "Lo’s words echoed a sentiment I heard many times in Hong Kong last year: a city dies when it can no longer determine its fate. By that standard, of course, Hong Kong has been dying for a long time. A Fortune magazine cover story titled “The Death of Hong Kong,” published in 1995, begins, “It’s time to stop pretending. Supposedly, Britain’s handover in less than 750 days of Hong Kong, the world’s most aggressively pro-business economy, to China, the world’s largest still officially communist dictatorship, is going to be a nonevent.” Predicting many of the erosions of judicial independence that have come to pass in the twenty-five years since, the piece characterized Hong Kong as “a captive colony of Beijing” that will increasingly resemble “just another mainland city, governed by corruption and political connections rather than the even-handed rule of law.”<br></br>",
                        "In Hong Kong, the question of laws—who gets to make them and what ends they should serve—is an existential one. “Whether we have a say in how we live defines whether we live,” is how a young protester put it to me in September. A previous version of the new law, which also sought to criminalize subversion against the mainland, was proposed in 2003 and abandoned after half a million Hong Kongers marched against it. “In 2003, there was anxiety about Beijing’s governance, but we weren’t empty of hope,” a retired schoolteacher told me. But Hong Kong’s resilience prevailed; until now, it always has."

                        "Last year, when we learned that Chinese paramilitary troops closed in near the mainland-Hong Kong border, I gathered my hard drives and notebooks to stash them in a safe spot, worried our homes and offices might get raided. We took out a stack of foreign currency from the bank and discussed places we could flee to with our pets, should an arrest become imminent. Hong Kong reporters have long been used to informal censorship — having our stories suddenly retracted, headlines changed, or pitches dismissed by editors. Still, we were not prepared for the new reality of possibly losing an eye, being physically assaulted, or getting arrested for doing our job.<br></br>",
                        "Hong Kong used to be the place where stories, books, and publications otherwise banned in the mainland found refuge and flourished. But with the National Security Law, we may be forced to follow the path of our mainland peers and forerunners who, over the past 30 years, have been sentenced to years in prison for endangering national security.<br></br>",

Self-censorship is almost like an instinct to mainland-based journalists because your career could end if you cross the “red line,” and no one knows where the “red line” lies.<br></br>",
                        "For a long time, the Hong Kong government has adhered to a “big market, small government” vision. It has remained one of the world’s freest economies for 25 years. Following this principle, the government should do very little to the economy and ensure enough freedom to build up a sustainable social and economic environment. Right now in Hong Kong, I can interview anyone and work on any story of public importance without worrying about retribution. But under the National Security Law, I worry that journalists like myself will become easy targets. It’s almost a Taiwan-like “white terror” for everyone living in the city: should I begin to self-censor like our mainland-based peers out of the need for self-preservation? Do I need to be concerned more about my personal safety than the public interests in my future reporting? Will the Chinese government prohibit me from going back to the mainland if I continue to do my job? However, despite these concerns, I will take up the challenge and make my work meaningful to society.<br></br><br></br>",

                        "Following is the full text of the video message by the Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam, at the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting today (June 30):<br></br>",
                        "Madam President,<br></br>",
                        "As Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, I welcome this opportunity to state our position on the enactment of national security legislation for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.<br></br>",
                        "National security is invariably under the purview of the central authorities, be it in China or any other countries. In all countries, the power to legislate on national security rests solely with the central government. Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China – a special administrative region enjoying a high degree of autonomy which comes directly under the Central Government. As an exceptional arrangement under the policy of &ldquo;One Country, Two Systems&rdquo;, the Basic Law governing the two Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao obliges the SAR to enact local legislation on its own to safeguard national security. Macao has successfully completed this task in 2009. Hong Kong, after a failed attempt in 2003, has not been able to fulfil its constitutional duty. For the sake of not only the 7.5 million Hong Kong residents, but also the 1.4 billion people in the Chinese mainland, the question of how long we could tolerate such a gaping hole in national security has to be asked, and answered.<br></br>",
                        "Legislation to safeguard national security is now urgently needed. Since last June, Hong Kong has been traumatised by escalating violence fanned by external forces. The threats of terrorist acts posed by illegal possession of explosives and firearms and the horrible menace faced by innocent Hong Kong people were recapped by my senior Police colleague Oscar Kwok and a prominent businesswoman Pansy Ho respectively when they spoke at this forum in March this year and September last year. Once rated as one of the safest cities in the world, security and stability have become relevant concerns.<br></br>",
                        "During this period, groups advocating &ldquo;Hong Kong independence&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; incited protesters, very often radicalised young people, to desecrate and burn the national flag, vandalise the national emblem and storm the Central Government's office in Hong Kong. Further, some local politicians proclaimed that they would paralyse the Hong Kong SAR Government while others campaigned for foreign governments to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs or even to impose sanctions on Hong Kong. No central government could turn a blind eye to such threats to sovereignty and national security as well as risks of subversion of state power. All in all, these acts have crossed the &ldquo;One Country&rdquo; red line and called for resolute action.<br></br>",
                        "As the highest organ of state power in China, the National People's Congress has the constitutional power and the duty to enact national security legislation for the Hong Kong SAR. The national law to be enacted has taken into account Hong Kong's actual situation and will be applied in Hong Kong by way of promulgation in accordance with the Basic Law. <br></br>",
                        "The legislation aims to prevent, curb and punish acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security. These crimes will be clearly defined in the law. It will only target an extremely small minority of people who have breached the law, while the life and property, basic rights and freedoms of the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong residents will be protected.<br></br>",
                        "Hong Kong is a free and diversified society. We respect differences in opinion and thrive on reaching consensus. But the “One Country” principle is non-negotiable and could not be compromised as without “One Country”, “Two Systems” will stand on shaky ground and Hong Kong's stability and prosperity will be at risk. For those foreign governments or politicians raising objections to the legislation, one could only lament the “double standards” they are adopting. All those countries which have pointed their fingers at China have their own national security legislation in place. We could think of no valid reason why China alone should be inhibited from enacting national security legislation to protect every corner of its territory and all of its nationals.<br></br>",
                        "Madam President, when I took office three years ago, I pledged to implement the “One Country, Two Systems” policy, uphold the Basic Law, defend the rule of law, and promote a deep and positive relationship between the Central Government and the Hong Kong SAR. Despite the escalating tensions in society in recent years, I remain hopeful that, with full conviction in “One Country, Two Systems” and upon implementation of the national security legislation, Hong Kong will ride out the political storm since last June and emerge stronger with stability restored. I and the Hong Kong SAR Government are determined to capitalise on our strengths, harness the opportunities presented by our country's development and provide Hong Kong people with brighter prospects.<br></br>",
                        "I urge the international community to respect our country's right to safeguard national security and Hong Kong people's aspirations for stability and harmony. Thank you."

I learned about Deng Xiaoping’s Opening Up and Reform movement in the 1980s, a moment of sudden and exhilarating change: as a market economy was introduced, state control over culture was loosened, and for the first time, foreign ideas flowed freely into the country—from KFC to Sartre to rock n’ roll. I learned how those very reforms brought rampant corruption, widespread inequality, and the desire for political change that eventually drove the students to Tiananmen Square. I read about rival student groups: those who wanted democratic reform without challenging the Party and those who wanted the Party overthrown. I read about the factions within the Party itself: the reformists urging for compromise and the hardliners calling for crackdown. I looked elsewhere, studying democracies (what was it that birthed and sustained them?) and autocracies (why did some change while others remained stubbornly in place?). I learned the theories of intellectuals and activists, from Vaclav Havel to Martin Luther King Jr. I picked up compound nouns like civil society and grassroots mobilization and incremental reform. I wanted to understand what had gone wrong at Tiananmen Square. I wanted to know what could’ve been changed then, what could still be changed now, and who had the power to do the changing.<br></br>",

No work of theory gave me that feeling that had driven me to seek it out in the first place. In time, I came to learn that there was actually a noun for that feeling. Common sense, Hannah Arendt called it—the shared reality that allows us to know ourselves, to know how we are connected to others, and to know how we belong to a common truth. It was common sense that taught us Hong Kongers to remember, uphold, and defend a truth that everybody else had chosen to forget. It was common sense that moved me and so many others to show up to the vigil, year after year, to gather and sing and pray. Vigil: the word derives from the Latin vigilia, or “awake.” Our vigils were as much an act of mourning as one of deliberate, collective wakefulness.<br></br>",
                        "[...]<br></br>",
                        "Two weeks ago, China’s legislature imposed a new national security law in Hong Kong, outlawing secession, subversion, terrorism, and interference by “foreign forces.” This means that future vigils in the city could be banned, and their organizers arrested. In the case of this year’s event, the Chinese government didn’t need to take recourse to the new law; the pandemic gave it an excuse to formally cancel this year’s vigil in the name of public health.<br></br>",
                        "When I heard the news, I felt nothing. In truth, I had no words to give. For the last few months, I had stared into a screen, body sinking deeper into a chair, scrolling through newsfeeds, swiping through headlines, peering into story after story playing like a surreal tragicomedy on loop. Cut off from the outside world—a place of sirens and teargas and viruses—I only wanted to withdraw. It turns out that Arendt had a word for this feeling too: loneliness. Loneliness, she argues, is the loss of our common sense, the shared reality that allows us to know ourselves, and how we are connected to others. Loneliness makes us sad and stupid, forces us to let go, withdraw, forget.<br></br>",
                        "Others were surely feeling lonely too. The presence of three thousand riot officers stationed around the city, in preparation for the anniversary, would have likely further dissuaded them from attempting to meet. And yet thousands of people did show up to the vigil on June 4. When I arrived at Victoria Park, just before eight, the streets were filled. Volunteers were handing out flyers, politicians were chanting slogans. People had pushed over the metal barriers lining the perimeter of the football pitches and streamed into the park. This year, there was no stage, no organizers, no mass prayer or song. People simply came, candles in hand, moved by common sense. The vigil represents common sense in its purest, physical form. So, too, do the protests that have broken out on American streets in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. These are occasions on which common sense is embodied, en masse. At these events, people gather to send a message: when the state peddles a lie, we will continue to live in truth, and when it isolates us from one another, we will live within it, together."

                        "Wearing black clothes. Writing 6.4 on light switches. Shining mobile phone lights. Sending smoke signals from a jail cell using a cigarette. These are all ideas suggested by Hong Kongers as ways to mark Friday’s anniversary of the June 4, 1989, killings in Beijing and elsewhere in China, including the massacre in and around Tiananmen Square. The modesty of these tiny gestures reflects one of the most dramatic deteriorations of freedom in the modern era.<br></br>",
                        "Just two years ago, 180,000 Hong Kongers crowded into Victoria Park for the annual candlelit vigil remembering those killings. This year, a ring of security will surround the park with 7,000 police officers deployed around the city to prevent people from gathering, bolstered by threats of five-year sentences for illegal assembly for anyone caught near the park wearing black clothes or with a candle. These dynamics underline just how much China’s Communist Party fears the power of public memory.<br></br>",

The result is that no one commemorates the June 4 anniversary more faithfully than the Communist Party itself. Its chosen methods — an uptick in censorship, the detention of dissidents, a security blanket around sensitive locations — neatly highlight the coercive force of a party that came to power through violence.<br></br>",
                        "Now, Beijing is clearly hoping to turn its Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong into a Special Amnesiac Region in its own image. First on the list is rewriting its recent history, in particular that of the massive pro-democracy movement that convulsed the city in 2019. Beijing is using draconian national security legislation, imposed on the territory last June, to criminalize a generation of politicians and reframe the protests. A case in point is the 47 politicians and activists who have been charged with subversion and accused of a “vicious plot” to paralyze the government. Their crime was holding unofficial primary polls to select their election candidates.<br></br>",
                        "But the assault on history will not stop there. This week, I learned that my own book can no longer be borrowed from Hong Kong’s public libraries. Along with other material newly classified as sensitive, it has been placed in the reference section. This means it can be consulted only in the building, as if removing it might let dangerous ideas run amok in the community.<br></br>",

                        "Yet Beijing’s dilemma is that in Hong Kong, it is dealing with a highly networked population that has received a Western-style education prioritizing critical thinking and intellectual inquiry. Crude attempts to brainwash or gaslight Hong Kongers are causing another brain drain, which will likely be larger than that seen before the 1997 transition to Chinese sovereignty. Hong Kong’s brightest and best are flocking overseas, taking with them their capital and their penchant for hard work.<br></br>",
                        "At the height of the 2019 protest movement, Hong Kong poet Tammy Ho Lai-Ming wrote, “At this moment, everyone is a revolution.” Now, in the face of an unpredictable and highly punitive legal system, that revolution has shrunk from massive public civil disobedience to small personal acts of resistance."

To Hongkongers, each of these dates is an occasion for commemoration and mourning. Even before the enactment of the National Security Law, and before the widespread disappearances of protest symbols, Hongkongers had developed the habit of commemorating these dates every month. On 8 and 15 June, Hongkongers gathered at Sheung Tak Estate and Pacific Place respectively to pay tribute to student Chow Tse-Lok and “raincoat man” Leung Ling-Kit—each of whom died during the 2019 anti-extradition protests. With bouquet of white flowers, Hongkongers create makeshift shrines to commemorate those who have lost their lives or were victimised by police in the past year.>",

A year after the 7.21 Yuen Long attack, in which hundreds of white-clad thugs indiscriminately attacked protesters, commuters, bystanders and journalists with metal rods and rattan sticks, the Hong Kong police announced that the incident was “a gang fight…involving participants from both sides”. Despite ample video footage from journalists and civilians that proved the contrary, the police denied the incident was an organised mob attack against unsuspecting victims.

As collective memories of the protest continue to percolate, they are grafted onto digital and material artefacts that circulate both locally and transnationally outside of Hong Kong. While to remember is to recall, and partially to relive, the trauma, the cost is far too high for us to forget."

                        "This year the Hong Kong vigil has been banned. Anyone gathering at the vigil site in Victoria Park on Friday could face five years in prison. Even publicising the event could lead to one year in jail under Hong Kong’s draconian National Security law, imposed sight unseen at the end of last June following a year of massive pro-democracy demonstrations. Public commemoration has become so risky that one Hong Kong newspaper even suggested writing the digits “64”, to commemorate the date of the protest, on light switches, so that flipping the switch became an act of remembrance. These moves underline the dangerous power of public memory, and how the events of 32 years ago still represent a suppurating sore at the moral heart of China’s Communist party.<br></br>",

                        "At Tiananmen vigils round the world last year, the events of Beijing 1989 and Hong Kong 2019 were yoked together. In Melbourne where I live, alternating footage from the two suppressions flickered across large outdoor screens to create a flashing montage of state violence, as those present shouted popular rallying cries including “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times!” That’s one of the protest slogans outlawed by the National Security Legislation, whose global reach is allowing Beijing to export its coercive amnesia far beyond its borders. This year, anyone – Hongkonger or not – shouting a forbidden protest slogan at a Tiananmen vigil anywhere in the world could find themselves in violation of the legislation.<br></br>",
                        "This has dramatically heightened the cost of public remembrance of 4 June, especially given the tendency of security officials from China’s diplomatic missions to monitor such gatherings. Even if the law is not easily enforceable overseas, it has a paralysing effect, leaving Hongkongers in other countries weighing up a stark calculation: whether attending a vigil might prevent them from returning home. Through its actions, Beijing has weaponised historical memory to the detriment of global freedoms of speech and expression.<br></br>",
                        "Open discussion of Hong Kong politics in global university classrooms has now become fraught, for students from Hong Kong or China, and for lecturers themselves. One friend at an American university told me they’d stopped teaching classes on Chinese politics, instead taking only one-on-one tutorials to ensure student safety. This immediately brought to mind a meeting I once had with a Chinese dissident, who’d asked me to come to an open pavilion on a hilltop in a park so we could see anyone approaching. Back then, some topics were too dangerous to broach in groups of more than two on the Chinese mainland. Now the same dynamics are beginning to apply in classrooms around the world. Using fear as a cudgel, China’s Communist party has succeeded in transplanting its closed discursive spaces into western academic institutions.<br></br>",
                        "Beijing’s epistemological campaign will not be content with choking off public commemorations of 4 June. Following the pattern laid down three decades before, another target is the reframing of the 2019 Hong Kong protest movement as a violent insurgency driven by hostile foreign forces. So long as western countries continue to act like Hong Kong is not their problem, Beijing will be empowered not just to excise the past, but also to rewrite the history of the present."

                        "The youth identity developments that I have explored are anchored by conflicts in cultural identity. A significant crisis that spurred the reverence for democratic ideals in Hong Kong youth, continually counter to Beijing’s anti-democratic propaganda in schools, is the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre. Immediately after the massacre, vigils were organized all around Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Federation of Students, and to this day this event occurs every June 4thin Victoria Park; a large park in the middle of Causeway Bay, the busiest and most economically productive area of the city which would later become a site of the UR. Every year, a candlelit vigil is held in solidarity for those killed. The actions of Hong Kong students in the organization of these vigils have given rise to the role of collective memory in framing a set of ideals and superimposing them on “our Hong Kong”. The creation of a geographic location that is a site for the outlet of political expression legitimizes and accepts youth identity as a form of political mobilization.<br></br>",
                        "The important role of the Hong Kong Federation of Students – as the dominant organizers of the vigil – in shaping collective memory and contemporary youth identity cannot be overstated. As China wants to tear down physical borders with Hong Kong, this vigil is one way in which the people of Hong Kong are constructing social borders. Therefore, “[c]ollective memory should be understood as those representations that serve as the basis of a group’s identity and sense of community.”[30] Images of Tank Man, along with journalists and arrested authors, are hung in Victoria Park and have become icons that Hong Kong collectively remembers as symbols of the democratic rights they are entitled to but which have not been respected. These vigils have taken on power in recent years wherein:<br></br>",
                        "the vigil in Hong Kong is a stark departure from the situation in China, where protests are banned and the mentions of the Tiananmen crackdown, in which hundreds if not thousands of protestors died, are scrubbed from social media.[31]<br></br>",
                        "They have become a way to create and contest memories, and by extension history, as a form of political mobilization that foils Hong Kong against China. China has responded to the growing power of these vigils through contesting this political memory. Donald Tsang, a former pro-Beijing Chief Executive of Hong Kong, stated in 2008 in regards to a question posed to him regarding the public release of information regarding the June 4th massacre that “China had achieved great development in various area” and that “people should look at the past more objectively.”[32] These comments were viewed as a departure of democratic representation of Hong Kong society and led to the pan-Democratic and Localist coalition boycotting Hong Kong SAR government meetings.[33] Thus students’ role in shaping collective memory politicizes history, and also contests memories by shaping and spreading local values through visual movements like the Victoria Park vigil."

                        "Five university heads last year signed a letter endorsing the national-security law, throwing their support behind the legislation before it was even made public. This move highlighted one of the more troubling aspects of the threats on campus, and within academia more broadly: The marching orders to suppress freedoms are being dutifully carried out not by police or the authorities, but by fellow colleagues, and even students. One postgraduate student at HKU has reported at least two faculty members to the tip line, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.<br></br>",
                        "“I think it is a very, very peculiar and an interesting thing, because it is not as if the body that is eroding academic freedom is outside the university. It is not a foreign body,” Peter Baehr, a research professor in social theory who has spent 21 years at Lingnan University, a liberal-arts college in Hong Kong, told me. Oftentimes, he said, “the most repressive actors are themselves professors.”<br></br>",
                        "Universities were established in Hong Kong during British colonial rule “as part of a grand plan to extend Britain’s imperial influence in China and the Far East,” John P. Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at HKU, wrote in a paper published last year examining higher education in the city. After Hong Kong was returned to China, in 1997, Beijing appeared to conceive of universities’ function, Burns wrote, primarily in terms of their “contribution to national development, their stabilizing role in Hong Kong and the mainland, and as institutions to transfer patriotic education to Hong Kong’s elite.” But the universities’ colonial legacy has led to tension with Beijing’s vision. (Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, serves as the chancellor of each of the eight publicly funded universities. The government also appoints members of each university’s council, a body similar to a board of trustees.)<br></br>",
                        "While mainland officials and their loyalists in Hong Kong have long targeted the city’s education sector as an area for reform, aiming to create a more patriotic population less likely to push back on Beijing’s growing influence and interference, their previous efforts were met with fierce resistance from students and parents. Protests broke out in 2012 over proposals to bring more nationalist teaching into classrooms. The idea was eventually shelved, but not before giving rise to a number of student leaders, some of whom would spend the better part of a decade proving to be formidable dissidents before being jailed or driven into exile in recent months. Notable among them was Joshua Wong, who two years after rallying the education-reform protests would rise to global recognition as one of the leaders of the Umbrella Movement.<br></br>",
                        "But in Hong Kong’s new political climate, resistance to Beijing is far more difficult. Wong is now in jail and facing charges under the national-security law. The overhaul of primary and secondary education he helped keep at bay is well under way, targeting students as young as 6 years old. Benny Tai, a legal scholar and former HKU professor targeted for years by Beijing, was sacked last year after being found guilty for his role in the 2014 Umbrella Movement demonstrations. Like Wong, he is now in jail and charged with violating the national-security law."
