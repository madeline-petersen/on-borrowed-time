                    "<br/>These talks followed on the heels of PRC leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous 1979 statement that those investing in (or thinking of investing in) the booming commercial and industrial metropolis of Hong Kong should “put their hearts at ease.” Amid the give-and-take of the negotiations, Deng had come to grasp that the preservation of Hong Kong’s distinctive capitalist system—and hence its ability to boost China’s economic development—would depend on a rocklike commitment to the “one country, two systems” model.<br>",
                    "<br/>That model, in turn, aimed to protect Hong Kong from the intrusion of China’s socialist system. The PRC was then in the early stages of reform after the chaos of the 1960s and 1970s, years of turbulence that had culminated in a high-level power struggle following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. Deng’s aim was for Hong Kong to be returned to China in a way that would preserve prosperity and social order and enable the city’s remarkably industrious and enterprising people to contribute to China’s modernization and economic development.<br>",
                    "<br/>He no doubt hoped that this respectful, arms-length approach would kindle Hong Kong’s loyalty in return. In order to work, the model had to win the confidence of Hong Kong’s people. The city’s liberal, free-spirited, capitalistic populace was not going to be reassured by mere pronouncements from a regime that many of them justifiably distrusted. Similarly, the international acceptance needed for foreign governments and enterprises to treat Hong Kong as a distinct entity in their financial and commercial dealings would require more than vague promises.<br>"

                    "In the beginning, many observers discovered that few Beijing leaders had a realistic and accurate understanding of Hong Kong. Those accustomed to viewing the world from the perspectives of a Chinese middle kingdom or Marxist philosophy seemed to be equally ignorant and self-righteous in their opinions about how a capitalist colony like Hong Kong could best be governed. This worried quite a number of the Hong Kong elite. There was much anxiety, and remedial lobbying (educating) efforts were undertaken by leading figures in the early stage of the negotiations. Fortunately, the leaders in Beijing were wise enough to put those in the know in key positions to deal with the British and Hong Kong representatives so that the damage was not too great.<br>",
                    "<br/>Next, the Hong Kong people were also frustrated because they could not take part in the negotiations affecting their own fate. Both the British and the Chinese claimed that they represented the interests of the Hong Kong people, but in fact they were overrepresented in some areas and inadequately represented in others. Throughout the whole process, they could only traverse the halls in Beijing and London to lobby the two negotiating parties. This they did to their own potential peril, since such actions implied their locus of loyalty and could affect future careers. Had Hong Kong been negotiating for postcolonial arrangements on its own, as many former British colonies have done, the situation would certainly have been different."

Peking has linked &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; with Chinese history, saying that it is designed to end the national division and separation caused by the confrontation between the two parties (Nationalist and Communist). &ldquo;One country, two systems&rdquo; has been used by Peking to arouse nationalistic and patriotic sentiment among Chinese, as part of the united &ldquo;frontline&rdquo; for patriotism, for the purpose of achieving the four modernizations and ultimately the reunification of China.<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Realism</em>—The single most important reason for &ldquo;one country and two systems&rdquo; is that socialism is not attractive to and Hong Kong. In exchange for sovereignty, Peking is willing to guarantee their present lifestyles and economic prosperity. For Hong Kong to maintain its status as an international financial centre the capitalist system should be retained. If the current system is changed artificially, its superiority and prosperity will be lost...<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Transition</em>—According to communist theory, human society evolves through stages from primitive communism, slave society, capitalism, socialism, and ultimately to communism. A process of development takes place within each stage. Marx said that socialist society, having been born out of capitalism, still carries tinges of the old capitalist society. Mao elaborated this further by distinguishing between minimum and maximum programs for socialism. Thus, in line with Marxist theory, the current Chinese Communist leadership claims that &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; acts as a &ldquo;historical transition before this country can thoroughly replace the capitalist system with a socialist system.&rdquo; In other words, the two systems will be merged into one after the transitional period.<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Subordination</em>—The scope and definition of the autonomy of Taiwan and Hong Kong will, of course, be decided by the central government in Peking. Governments in Taiwan and Hong Kong will be subordinate governments powerless to declare war, conduct their own defense, foreign affairs, or peace negotiations. Socialism will be the main political system, because the 1 billion people on the mainland will continue to practice socialism. Capitalism will be allowed to exist as a &ldquo;supplement to the development of socialism.&rdquo;<br>"

                    "<br>The model of &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; envisages the co-existence of two distinct legal systems alongside one another. On one side of the border, there is a well established common law system that is based on Western liberalism and the doctrine of separation of powers. The judiciary is the guard- ian of human rights and the rule of law, and enjoys an exclusive power to interpret legislation and declare the common law. On the other side of the border, legal order has been re-established only since 1978. The country is still in the process of seeking a proper model of legal system that befits the characteristics of a developing economic power under a constitution that is shaped by Socialism/Maoism and Chinese history and culture. The Chinese legal system is based on both the socialist system and the civil law system, but it is subject to increasing influence from the common law system in recent years. A major characteristic of the Chinese legal system, as inherited from the socialist tradition, is its rejection of the doctrine of separation of powers. All powers are vested in the supreme soviet, namely the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPC). As an elected body representing the people, the NPC exercises legislative, executive and judicial powers. The power of final interpretation of law is vested in the legislative rather than the judicial organ. While there is gradual acceptance of the desirability of having a judiciary exercising independent adjudicatory power (as opposed to having an independent judiciary), the judiciary on the Mainland remains a relatively weak institution and the PRC Constitution is by and large not justiciable in courts. Thus, there is a huge ideological gap between the two systems. This gap manifests itself and results in conflicts when the two systems interact with one another. The Basic Law itself provides the best example of the interface of the two systems. In Ma Wai Kwan Davidv HKSAR, Chief Judge Chan described perceptively the nature of the Basic Law as follows:<br>",
                    "<br/>&ldquo;The Basic Law is a unique document. It reflects a treaty made between two nations. It deals with the relationship between the sovereign and an autonomous region which practises a different system. It stipulates the organisations and functions of the different branches of government. It sets out the rights and obligations of the citizens. Hence, it has at least three dimensions: international, domestic and constitutional. It must also be borne in mind that it was not drafted by common law lawyers. It was drafted in the Chinese language with an official English version but the Chinese version takes precedence in case of discrepancies. That being the background and features of the Basic Law, it is obvious that there will be difficulties in the interpretation of its various provisions.&rdquo;<br>",
                    "<br/>&ldquo;Alongside the huge ideological gap and the vastly different stages of development between the HKSAR and the Mainland legal systems lies the great imbalance of political powers between the Special Administrative Region and its sovereign. When there is no clear demarcation of when two systems end and one country begins, and when mutual trust has not been fully established, it is not surprising that attempts were made by both sides to explore and perhaps also to exploit the boundary separating the two systems. This inevitably leads to controversies and conflicts, and is best exemplified by the conflicts arising from the dual nature of the Basic Law as a piece of national legislation of the PRC and as a constitution of the HKSAR. In a way, the first decade of constitutional experience in Hong Kong can be said to be a story of a delicate exploration in an uncharted sea.&rdquo;<br>"

                    "On April 17 student mourning activities began to spread from the Beijing campuses into the nation&rsquo;s symbolic central space, Tiananmen Square. The Square lies at the geographic center of the capital city and just southeast of Zhongnanhai, where the last dynasty&rsquo;s emperors had their hunting park and where the top Communist leaders now work. Beginning with the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Tiananmen has also become a traditional site for popular protests. These protests have often been led by university students, who are especially numerous here because Beijing is the country&rsquo;s preeminent center of higher education.<br/>",
                    "At People&rsquo;s University a &ldquo;Democracy Wall&rdquo; appeared on the evening of April 17. Spontaneous memorial activities took place on other campuses that until now had been quiet. In addition to pasting up eulogies, memorial couplets, and posters, students made speeches, set up symbolic biers, and delivered wreaths to the Square. Some even demanded to attend the funeral. In a single day, ninety-three handwritten memorial couplets appeared at the Beijing University of Science and Engineering."

As the students straggled out of the square hand in hand, singing the “Internationale” and the Chinese national anthem, tears poured down their cheeks."

                    "On April 28, 1988, the BLDC published the draft Basic Law for public consultation. The community response to Article 22 varied. Some regarded it as necessary to ensure the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Others rejected it on the grounds that it was not referred to in the Joint Declaration; that it was unnecessary because Hong Kong had similar laws; or that it might infringe the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people. In particular it was said that subversion was an offense not known to &ldquo;democratic countries&rdquo; and therefore, should not be introduced into Hong Kong. Another major concern expressed in the consultation process was the uncertain nature of the terms &ldquo;undermining national unity.&rdquo;&lsquo;23 Undermining national unity was a criminal offense unknown to both Chinese and Hong Kong law. Hong Kong&rsquo;s reunification was all about national unity, however, and China was not prepared to soften its position on this issue."

                    "The draft Article 22 was amended after this consultation. The amendments were made on the basis of the principle that, &ldquo;The wording of [Article 22] may be amended, but its fundamental spirit should not be changed. The amendments were as follows: 1) The clause &ldquo;subvert the Central People&rsquo;s Government&rdquo; was replaced by &ldquo;treason&rdquo;; and 2) The clause &ldquo;any act of treason, secession, sedition or theft of state secrets&rdquo; was inserted to replace &ldquo;any act designated to undermine national unity.&rdquo; Article 23, (the previous Article 22), was drafted as follows: The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or theft of state secrets. 26 There was no explanation offered as to why these particular offenses were included in Article 23, although it was clear that the amendment took into consideration both the existing Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese laws and China&rsquo;s political concerns. It was a compromise that seemed to satisfy both sides. China was satisfied because both treason and subversion were offenses in its criminal laws, and treason at common law was broad enough to absorb much &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; behavior. China&rsquo;s national security was sufficiently protected by these additional three offenses. The compromise was also acceptable to Hong Kong because subversion and undermining national unity were replaced by treason and other offenses, which were defined with some sort of clarity and also had a long history at common law."

They were disillusioned with the Chinese government and its promises to Hong Kong by the sudden twists and turns of events on the mainland. The sudden outpouring of emotions and political activism among the Hong Kong Chinese, especially the Hongkongese, can be interpreted as a vivid expression of the Hong Kong identity, which in this case was also shared to a substantial degree by those who identi- fied themselves as Chinese. The year 1989 can thus be considered as a milestone in the formation of the local identity among the Hong Kong Chinese."

I trust that I shall not overstep the boundaries of convention which bind maiden speakers, but I share with the noble Baroness her concern for the future of the people and territory of Hong Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>In December 1984, during the debate on the joint agreement with China, my great friend Lord Birkenhead made his maiden speech. Sadly, Robin Birkenhead is now dead but I should like to remind your Lordships of his words. On that occasion he said: &ldquo;we do not have to live, except in our consciences, with the consequences of this agreement; the people of Hong Kong do. Many of them have risked their lives and abandoned everything to escape from Communism. One cannot possibly expect enthusiasm at the prospect of being handed back to a Communist power, however many safeguards are built into their return&rdquo;.—[Official Report, 10/12/84; col. 32.] That was four and a half years ago and today we must address ourselves urgently to the same question.<br>",
                    "</br>Appalling as were the recent events in Peking, they should not have come as a surprise. There had already been a dress rehearsal in Tibet for the brutalities committed in Tiananmen Square. On at least four separate occasions during the past three years—and most recently in March of this year—Chinese troops and police opened fire on and killed unarmed demonstrators. That happened in spite of the fact that freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of demonstration are protected under Article 35 of the Constitution of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. But to its shame the world ignored the warnings from Tibet until minds were wonderfully concentrated by the events on 3rd and 4th June. If the mask had slipped in Tibet, it has now been ripped away and the face of totalitarian China has been exposed.<br>",
                    "</br>That is the power to which we are to hand over Hong Kong and with no more guarantee than the hope that China will abide by the joint agreement. gut after the experience of the past three weeks the people of Hong Kong need more than hope to persuade them that they are not to be delivered defenceless to the mercies of the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army. They need the assurance that if the worst comes to the worst they have in the last resort somewhere to go; an alternative to the bullet and the confession.",
                    "</br>Whereas under the process of decolonisation other Crown colonies were led to or took the path to independence, as the noble Baroness has said, that option was denied to Hong Kong. The right of domicile in the United Kingdom was progressively removed between 1962 and 1981 under the Commonwealth Immigration Act and its subsequent amendments.<br>",
                    "</br>Over the past three weeks the people of Hong Kong have experienced kaleidoscopic emotions: first, of pride and happiness for their fellow countrymen in China as the prospect of greater freedom rose before them; then of anger, shock and compassion; and, finally, of apprehension and fear that what happened in China and Tibet today would happen tomorrow in Hong Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>What is now needed to restore the confidence of Hong Kong is the recognition that we have certain inescapable obligations and that the necessary steps will be taken to meet them. Speedier progress to democratic government, yes; a Bill of Rights, yes. However, they are the icing and what is needed is the cake. They can be no substitute for the fundamental need for an ultimate sanctuary.<br>",
                    "</br>The course advocated by the present Governor, Sir David Wilson, is that we should grant full British passports to the 1.25 million people who currently hold British National (Overseas) passports and to the further 2 million people who are eligible to hold them. I do not believe that such a generous step would mean an unmanageable influx of immigrants from Hong Kong. Their lives are in Hong Kong and they would wish to continue to live there. Paradoxically, the assurance that people could leave would have the effect of encouraging them to stay, for a prison to which you have the key is no longer a prison.<br>",
                    "</br>For my part, I do not believe it quite necessary to go so far as to give immediate right of abode to those 3.25 million who are potentialy eligible in Hong Kong. Certainly those most at risk should have that right and I urge the Government substantially to increase the degree of flexibility in awarding full British passports.<br>",
                    "</br>If Portugal with its smaller population can give to over 100,000 of the citizens of Macao the right of abode in the EC, we can surely give several hundred thousand passports to the people of Hong Kong. I mention the EC because of course by 1992 a British passport will also be a passport to Europe and not all the Hong Kong people will wish to make their home here in the United Kingdom.<br>",
                    "</br>The numbers may seem daunting but this Government have never shirked a challenge. If France has absorbed nearly 2 million immigrants from its overseas territories, we can surely do no less for our subjects in far more deserving circumstances. If Europe&rsquo;s population is increased by a maximum of 1 per cent., that is a tiny price to pay for saving a brave nation from the worst horrors of communism.<br>",
                    "</br>I do not say that Armageddon is coming. However, I say that if it does come we should be prepared. I urge the Government to take the decisions which will satisfy both our honour and our responsibility.<br>",
                    "</br>3.34pm<br>",
                    "</br>Baroness Young—My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for introducing this important debate today and also by congratulating my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke on his maiden speech.<br>",
                    "</br>This debate comes almost exactly one year since we last debated Hong Kong and it is difficult to overstate the change in the situation since that occasion. We have all been appalled by the actions of the Chinese Government over the treatment of the peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square, and no one can ever forget the spectacle on our television screens of the Chinese army literally crushing students who were peacefully trying to express their point of view. We are horrified at the death penalties 233carried out, with more unquestionably to come. Those actions have shocked and appalled the entire world. I express for everyone, I am sure, our deepest sympathy and understanding for the very real concerns of the people of Hong Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>Arising from that dreadful background it is all the more important to consider carefully what the reaction of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government should be to this issue of Hong Kong. I start by placing on record my support for my right honourable and learned friend the Foreign Secretary and the measures that he has already taken against China: a ban on arms sales; a suspension of all scheduled exchanges between Britain and China; a suspension of the visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales; and suspension of all high-level military contacts. I also think that we greatly benefit from my right honourable friend&rsquo;s wise counsel on the situation in Hong Kong and his unwillingness, in my view quite properly, to be pushed precipitously into actions which in many cases have not been fully thought through.<br>",
                    "</br>I am glad that my right honourable and learned friend is to visit Hong Kong shortly. He can then judge for himself the situation on the ground and, above all, can assure the people of Hong Kong that we shall fulfil our obligations and responsibility for the administration of Hong Kong up to 1997. I also place on record my support for the governor, Sir David Wilson, in these difficult times and for the excellent job that he is doing.<br>",
                    "</br>What, then, should we do? The fact is that the historic and geographical realities of the situation of Hong Kong remain. Any viable future for Hong Kong must be dependent upon its co-operation and coexistence with China. Nothing can alter those facts, disagreeable though they may be. Under the lease, 92 per cent. of Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. I recall, as a Foreign Office Minister, commending to your Lordships the Hong Kong agreement—the Sino-British Agreement on Hong Kong. I believe it to be a good agreement. Some people have suggested that we should either scrap it or try to renogotiate it. I believe that that would be a great mistake. We want to see it implemented. Nor is there any evidence that if we did reopen negotiations we would get a better agreement.<br>",
                    "</br>One further positive point remains. It is in China&rsquo;s long-term interests to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. As all speakers have said, we must try to keep up that confidence in Hong Kong. I welcome the proposals that have been made for an increase in democracy. I also welcome the fact that the Hong Kong police force has been strengthened under the control of the Hong Kong Government. I hope that on the tragic situation of the Vietnamese refugees there will be some improvement arising from the discussions at Geneva. That seems to be the case.<br>",
                    "</br>Attention has focused on the question of whether, given the changed situation, we should give an undertaking of the right of abode to some 3.25 million people from Hong Kong. It is a matter of much regret to me that I have not been able to speak, before this debate, to Dame Lydia Dunn, who I 234know is in London, and to hear, first hand, her concerns. Of course we all understand their fears. Who could not? I shall therefore listen with great interest to what my noble friend the Minister has to say this afternoon on the point raised about a further examination, particularly under the nationality Acts, of the position of Crown servants and key business people. I was also interested to read what my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in another place yesterday, when she referred to increased flexibility under the nationality Acts. Both statements I welcome, and I hope that my noble friend can say something further on this matter.<br>",
                    "</br>On the wider issue of whether or not we should give a right of abode to the 3.25 million people in Hong Kong I would like to expand further, but time does not allow. But I say this: it is an immensely difficult issue. The British Parliament must not only consider its obligations to the people of Hong Kong, real and important as those are, but also its obligations to the people of the United Kingdom. Indeed, as the representatives in another place are elected to represent the people of the United Kingdom, their first duty must be to the people whom they represent. In answering this question I believe it must be clear that Britain could not guarantee a right of abode to all these people.<br>",
                    "</br>I believe there is a danger as regards the insurance argument because no government could make that commitment without being prepared to make arrangements to receive for right of abode 3.25 million people. It really would not be fair to the people of Hong Kong, let alone to the people in this country, to pretend otherwise. Those who have to take responsibility often have to say things that they would rather not say and that are very painful and disagreeable. I believe that this is one instance of them. That said, we have all referred to what is called the Armageddon situation. We must profoundly hope and pray that it does not happen. From what my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, I recognise that should that situation arise we shall seek the help of the rest of the world in trying to resolve what will be not only a desperately tragic situation for Hong Kong, but a tragedy for the whole world.<br>"

During the poignant ceremony, participants would light candles, sing pro-democracy songs, listen to survivors’ testimonies and perform Chinese funeral rituals to mourn the people killed in the crackdown. Although most mourners did not participate directly in the movement, the ritualistic practices would serve as their annual reminder of the momentous event. Such practices would reopen the repository of history, allowing them to revisit, and possibly preserve and pass on, the painful memories of the crackdown—which have been heavily censored and suppressed in mainland China to the present day."

                    "In 1997, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s ninety-nine year lease with China will expire, and sovereignty of Hong Kong and the governing of its six million people will transfer to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC). Because Hong Kong has become a highly developed economic center, the economic and social implications of this transfer are far-reaching. Business is the soul of Hong Kong; the colony&rsquo;s survival will depend on China&rsquo;s tolerance of a &ldquo;capitalist enclave on its socialist soil.&rdquo; British and Chinese officials entered into talks relating to the transfer in 1982. These talks concluded with the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong (Joint Declaration) in 1984. The Joint Declaration states that Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC and retain a high degree of autonomy as a capitalist system for at least fifty years after 1997.<br></br>",
                    "The Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, however, dissolved Hong Kong residents&rsquo; confidence in the Joint Declaration, and many began to doubt whether their personal liberties and lifestyles would truly remain protected after the takeover date of July 1, 1997. In 1990, the Basic Law-the law which will govern Hong Kong for the fifty years after the takeover-was promulgated after debate and numerous objections by the members of the drafting committee from Hong Kong. In many respects, the Basic Law is inconsistent with the Joint Declaration and the PRC constitution.&rsquo; Furthermore, in 1997, the Basic Law, as well as future Hong Kong legislation will be subordinate to the PRC constitution, and China will ultimately be in charge.&rsquo; <br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "Although emigration from Hong Kong has steadily increased since 1984, the mixed messages residents of Hong Kong received from the PRC in 1989 and 1990 caused a flood of residents to look for a country to move to before the 1997 takeover. The United States, Canada, and Australia began to receive large numbers of requests for immigration from Hong Kong residents. Some Hong Kong companies even set up overseas offices to satisfy their employees&rsquo; demands for foreign passports. Approximately one in ten Hong KongChinese will have acquired foreign nationality by 1997.&ldquo; Approximately 1.04 percent of Hong Kong&rsquo;s workforce emigrated in 1994 alone.&rdquo;"

                    "Although not everyone who says he will leave will do so, the idea of emigration is pervasive. There have been two Chinese-language comedies on television — Priceless Adventure and Uncle Bill and Aunt Lydia -- that draw on emigration for a theme. In my middle-class neighborhood Chu&rsquo;s Photo Shop displays a poster demonstrating that it can take pictures of the exact style and quality required for Canadian and U.S. visas. At a newsstand nearby I can buy the Hong Kong Standard, which regularly publishes a separate section on Canada. If I buy the South China Morning Post instead, I may come across an ad for fur-lined raincoats, clearly aimed at the Canada-bound. Or I can buy The Emigrant, a glossy Chinese-English magazine, circulation 25,000, which offers tips and background information for would-be emigrants. The pages are filled with display ads from moving companies, a pet transport service, and emigration consultants, who seek out business opportunities and help with the paperwork. A short walk beyond the newsstand, a real-estate office advertises mock-Tudor houses in Britain and a tour agency books flights on Canadian Airlines International, which offers more than twice as many flights to Canada as it did five years ago. At the airport one can buy books like Successful Migrating to Australia and New Zealand -- An Ideal Destination for Migrants and even picture books of Belize, which, until it stopped the program in late 1989 had sold citizenship to several hundred worried Hong Kong residents for a bargain price of $23,800."

                    "I am currently a 16-year-old junior at Hong Kong International School, the only American high school here. I was born in San Francisco, where both of my parents moved from Hong Kong when they were quite young, and I lived there for about six years. Having begun my life in a pretty typical American environment, I wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled as a first grader when my father&rsquo;s business brought our family to Hong Kong. It took me a couple of years before I finally grew accustomed to our new life, and even longer before I gladly accepted the move. For the longest time, I was a nagging daughter, asking at least once a week when we were going to &ldquo;go back&rdquo; to the States. Over the years, however, Hong Kong has really grown on me. Although I&rsquo;m definitely going back to the US for college and, hopefully, my career, I&rsquo;m in no way ruling Hong Kong, this unique place, out of my future.<br></br>",
                    "I&rsquo;d say that the community I live in is quite different, and maybe even a little removed, from what people would call &ldquo;Hong Kong society&rdquo;. My school is pretty much a community in and of itself, rather remotely located in the south side of the island, which is sort of like a suburb of Hong Kong. Many of the students live in this area, as well. A large part of the student body is made up of expatriates from the US. Of course, if you took a sampling of our student population, you&rsquo;d find among them a number of locals, ABCs (American-born Chinese) such as myself, Canadians, and many others from various countries all over the world. Oftentimes I feel that we at the Hong Kong International School live in a world almost separate from that of the rest of the people in Hong Kong, not really being able to know how the locals think and feel. My school has a reputation for affluence, and this contributes to furthering the distance between the greater community and our own. Even so, my community is strongly impacted by what goes on in Hong Kong, especially by the changes taking place regarding the handover that will take place in about two months.<br></br>",
                    "When I was younger, the year 1997, which has carried much significance to the people here for the past decades, always seemed far away. I never expected it to come so soon; I always thought my family would have moved back to the States by the time it arrived. So, I was taken a bit by surprise when, during my recent visit to the US for the Christmas holidays, I found myself feeling solemn among the noise-makers and streamers of the cheerful revelers who welcomed in the New Year. To my ears, their shouts of &ldquo;1997!&rdquo; had a rather ominous ring.<br></br>",
                    "Personally, I&rsquo;m sorry to see Britain go after having established a very successful system in a prospering city. At the same time, I have mixed feelings about China taking over again. On the one hand, as a Chinese person, I should be proud that my &ldquo;mother country,&rdquo; so to speak, is regaining control of something that is rightfully hers. I also have some faith that China will be sensible enough to leave the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong&rsquo;s people alone. On the other hand, I fear that the plays for power going on right now between locals, Chinese leaders, and a few remaining figures of British authority may contribute to a possible downfall of our flourishing colony. Ultimately, I hope that China will respect the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; agreement and will make decisions that will ensure the stability and continuation of Hong Kong&rsquo;s success.<br></br>",
                    "As the British move out and the Chinese come back in, many people&rsquo;s lives are going to be dramatically affected. There are locals who have emigrated to other countries--mostly to the US, Canada and Australia--and are staying there. There are also many who have recently come back from these countries to live in Hong Kong for the meantime; they had initially left so that a door would be open for them just in case something should happen here that might threaten their safety. However, there are locals who can&rsquo;t afford to leave Hong Kong, who just have to stay here and see what happens.<br></br>",
                    "My situation is a bit different. Having originally come to Hong Kong from the States as an American citizen, I don&rsquo;t have as much to worry about. I can basically leave any time I want to, and I don&rsquo;t plan to remain here permanently, anyway. I&rsquo;m staying here for another year to finish my senior year of high school, and then going back to the US for college. My parents, also US citizens, can leave if they feel the need to. They are both working here, however, and are unsure about their future. At the moment,they are looking at possibly staying for a few more years and then returning to the US, or maybe somewhere else in Asia where business opportunities exist. Like most others in Hong Kong, my family faces an uncertain future, but I hope things will remain stable here when the Chinese take over so that nothing drastic comes to pass."

                    "At this very instant, the neon red digits on a clock in the heart of Beijing are flashing away audaciously, counting down to the second exactly how much time is left until the historic handover takes place. When I went to Beijing this summer, I was chilled to the bone as I stared at these incessantly blinking numbers, and realized there was only one year left. Now there is a mere month left, according to the ‘handover clock&rsquo; recently installed at the local Regent Hotel, and I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to believe July 1st is approaching so quickly...<br></br>",
                    "Just the other day, a reporter from a major Hong Kong newspaper came to the school I attend, qhixh is in a rather affluent area. He approached me and two of my friends with some questions that really started me thinking and helped me to realize some things. Among them, one in particular stands out prominently in my thoughts. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t have a foreign passport and didn&rsquo;t have the means to obtain one, how would you feel about the nearing handover knowing you would have to stay in Hong Kong indefinitely?&rdquo; he asked.<br></br>",
                    "All three of us remained silent for quite a while, not knowing how to answer. As I turned the matter over in my head for a few moments, I realized how fortunate many of us in my community are. We are free from many of the worries and concerns that burden the lives of countless local people. While those like myself have the comfort of knowing that we can leave the territory any time things get out of hand or in the case we are forced to change our way of life, others don&rsquo;t. They have to stay here and comply with whatever China demands. For this reason, I honestly hope that the Chinese will be reasonable and understanding of the needs of the people, although in the past, they have often acted otherwise towards their citizens. I also fear that a loss of freedom of speech and of the press will silence all complaints and opportunities for negotiation, which are presently open and vital to the locals here. Although it probably doesn&rsquo;t affect me directly, the more I think about them, I&rsquo;m becoming increasingly concerned about these issues.<br></br>",
                    "Because the majority of the students in my community are similarly free from much worry about the imminent transition, many of them, sadly, don&rsquo;t have much interest in what is going to happen in the very near future. As one of my friends explained to the newspaper reporter a few days ago, many of us see it nothing more than a significant historic event. Most locals, on the other hand, view China&rsquo;s return as something with the potential to greatly interfere in their everyday lives. Personally, as time approaches that fateful midnight hour, my interest is becoming increasingly stirred up. I wait not only in excited anticipation of the countless festivities and parties --planned years ahead of time--that will accompany the handover, but also with anxious apprehension over how Hong Kong will be reshaped once the fervor dies down.<br></br>",
                    "As somewhat tacky, over-the-top souvenirs flood the shops, along with the an overwhelming number of camera-toting tourists who to pour in daily, I wonder how so many of my classmates can leave the territory for the summer holidays before the end of June, knowing they are missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take part in such a momentous piece of history-in-the-making. As for myself, I am profoundly grateful for the chance to eyewitness this event will bring thousands from around the world to Hong Kong.<br></br>"

The mass media and pro-Beijing organisations are creating a joyful atmosphere for the people of Hong Kong. But are we really happy?<br></br>",
                    "For myself, the end of the colonial rule is certainly great. Even though Hong Kong has been ruled by Britain more than 150 years. I have strong feelings of connection to my motherland. When my family and I were watching the Olympic Games, we concerned ourselves with the performance of China&rsquo;s teams and were proud of their victories. Few Hong Kong people, I believe, would deny their Chinese indentities. In this sense, we are eager to see the reunification. But there are doubts as well.<br></br>",

                    "Why, merely a few days before the sovereignty handover, do so many Hong Kong people still not share the joy? It is because the government-in-waiting is still not able to give us a satisfactory arrangement in terms of our political system and human rights protections.<br></br>",
                    "The news reports of Tiananmen Square now filled with Beijing people taking photos, and waving the five-star PRC (Chinese) flag along with the bauhinia-embellished flag of HKSAR (Hong Kong) seemed ironically funny to me. The streets of Beijing are full of decorations in honour of the handover. However, in Hong Kong, such scenery is not as easy to find. When interviewed by journalists, some Honk Kong people said that the most significant thing about the handover was that they would get a five-day vacation in its honour. Other people also complained the media coverage of handover was &ldquo;too much&rdquo; and decided to travel abroad during this time.<br></br>",
                    "For the businessmen, the handover is a good opportunity. In addition to the summer and Christmas sales, we now have reunification sales in the retail stores. Someone questioned whether it is appropriate and justifiable for the government to spend millions of dollars on the celebrations, while our elderly citizens receive only is about $300 (US) a month, an amount the government has refused to increase.<br></br>",
                    "Academics have warned of the potential for social unrest; this worries me, too. As our community is presented to the world in bubbles of prosperity and happiness, we will experience great disappointment if, after the handover, we are faced with a series of restrictions on our civil liberties, a pushing back of the democratic movement, an unhealthy rise in property prices and an increasing disparity of wealth. However, I hope that Hong Kong people will think more about these things and not bury our heads in the sand.<br></br>"

                    "Hong Kong is quite acquainted with having planeloads of tourists coming in to explore its outer islands, historical sites, and quaint souvenir-shops. In fact, the tourist industry here has been extremely successful for as long as I can remember. At present, however, there has been an obvious increase in the number of people walking around the streets carrying cameras and speaking less familiar languages. Most notable has been the increase in the number of Mandarin-speaking people (the languages usually spoken in Hong Kong are Cantonese and English), heralding the arrival of the many more mainlanders to come in the next few years.<br></br>",
                    "The whole atmosphere of Hong Kong is changing, and one can almost sense a different feeling in the air. What I am most impressed with, however, is the attention the international media are giving to Hong Kong. Before the approach of this prodigious event, most people had no idea where Hong Kong was and probably didn&rsquo;t even care that much. Now, the world is being given the opportunity to focus its attention here and learn to a little about a place they never knew much about before.<br></br>",
                    "The whole city is pretty much buzzing right now. The upcoming event is all many people can talk about, and local newspapers just can&rsquo;t print enough material concerning the handover. There has been so much fuss about it that many people have acquired what has jokingly been labelled as &ldquo;handover fatigue&rdquo;. Nevertheless, I have been enjoying the excitement.<br></br>",
                    "The stately skyline has been set ablaze with the colorful lights that decorate the buildings; the streets are adorned with banners. There have been countless special events, shows, concerts, exhibitions, parties, etc., going on every day for the two months that preceded the transition. Some of these mark the sad farewell Britain is bidding the crown colony it fostered for so long. Others joyously proclaim China&rsquo;s proud reunification with its long-lost entity. In either case, strong nationalism exudes from both sides.<br></br>",
                    "Just the other night, I attended a concert given by the English military marching bands, who are due to set sail back to the UK in a couple of days. As the familiar strains of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; reached my ears, I saw the governor Chris Patten as well as many other British proudly singing to the tune. It was a sentimental moment, and I could feel the dignified sadness they were experiencing . These British people are concluding a prosperous rule here, and many are preparing to return to their homes. On the other hand, the glimpses of Chinese performances I&rsquo;ve caught on the news have all been very bright--and a little overly-optimistic in my opinion.<br></br>",
                    "Within my own group of relatives and close friends, &ldquo;celebrations&rdquo; are also being planned. On the night of June 30th, I will be getting together with my mother&rsquo;s side of the family at a relative&rsquo;s house for a big dinner. We&rsquo;ll be watching the fireworks from her balcony and witnessing the handover ceremony on TV. On July 1st, I&rsquo;m eating another big dinner with my dad&rsquo;s side of the family as well as some friends, several of whom have flown over from the States. Many of my friends are doing something similar, while some whom I&rsquo;ve talked to still haven&rsquo;t planned anything yet. I anticipate a smooth transition and hope that nothing very drastic will occur to disrupt Hong Kong&rsquo;s normal peaceful atmosphere. It&rsquo;s only a matter of days until the world will be able to witness this century-long awaited event!<br></br>"

Even though they did not share political fate with the mainland Chinese before 1997, Hong Kong Chinese still had tremendous empathy with their fellow compatriots. To many Hong Kong Chinese, colonial rule, though basically benign and tolerable, was still demeaning and occasionally outrageous. Racial discrimination, though increasingly taking a subtle form, was still an intrinsic feature of colonial rule which constantly reminded the colonized of their common Chineseness. Undoubtedly, communism was repulsive to the Hong Kong Chinese, but the fact that the Chinese Communists had performed the feats of shaking China off from foreign control and building China into a major power in the world had left a strong, albeit paradoxical, impression on them. Still, as Hong Kong was a sanctuary to many people there, Chinese nationalism and anti-colonialism had never been potent forces in shaping the identity of the Hong Kong Chinese. Though a small portion of the Hong Kong Chinese supported either the communist regime in the mainland or the nationalist regime in Taiwan, most were however politically detached."

Nowhere in their thinking was there much room for Hong Kong&rsquo;s local population, whom until recent memory were barred from the clubs, management suites and halls of government.

Yet, adult leaders of the Occupy Central Movement have surprisingly played a minor role; they mainly offered consultation to the student leaders and helped with management affairs. The students have played the major role and have veered the course of the movement all along. They negotiated with officials of the HKSAR government; they proposed terms of negotiation, and they asked for a direct dialogue with Beijing. It is from this perspective that we can define the Umbrella Movement essentially as a student movement.&rdquo;"

Armed with a self-protective mentality, this upcoming generation was formed with neither the recollection of Hong Kong’s colonial past nor any loyalty towards China. This emerging identity was rooted in a new preconception of what it means to be a “Hongkonger”."

                  "&ldquo;In the 24 years since 1997, Hong Kong has seen a series of peaks and troughs in mass political mobilization, with people again and again using the streets as their stage for protest. While victories have been rare, these movements have shaped the cycles of optimism and anguish that have been integral to the crystallization of the Hongkonger identity that emerged from this undemocratic yet open society. I am part of what Financial Times correspondent Benjamin Bland has labeled Generation HK in his book of the same title: the children raised to adulthood in the SAR, the babies born in the blurry threshold of pre-and-post 1997, the teenagers and 20-somethings who laid their lives on the line in the heat of 2019. With no memories of a British Hong Kong, and no attachment to China, mine is the generation that most adamantly regards itself as “Hongkongers”— a term added to the Oxford English Dictionary after the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement brought the city to a 79-day standstill in 2014.&rdquo;"
