                    "<br/>These talks followed on the heels of PRC leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous 1979 statement that those investing in (or thinking of investing in) the booming commercial and industrial metropolis of Hong Kong should “put their hearts at ease.” Amid the give-and-take of the negotiations, Deng had come to grasp that the preservation of Hong Kong’s distinctive capitalist system—and hence its ability to boost China’s economic development—would depend on a rocklike commitment to the “one country, two systems” model.<br>",
                    "<br/>That model, in turn, aimed to protect Hong Kong from the intrusion of China’s socialist system. The PRC was then in the early stages of reform after the chaos of the 1960s and 1970s, years of turbulence that had culminated in a high-level power struggle following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976. Deng’s aim was for Hong Kong to be returned to China in a way that would preserve prosperity and social order and enable the city’s remarkably industrious and enterprising people to contribute to China’s modernization and economic development.<br>",
                    "<br/>He no doubt hoped that this respectful, arms-length approach would kindle Hong Kong’s loyalty in return. In order to work, the model had to win the confidence of Hong Kong’s people. The city’s liberal, free-spirited, capitalistic populace was not going to be reassured by mere pronouncements from a regime that many of them justifiably distrusted. Similarly, the international acceptance needed for foreign governments and enterprises to treat Hong Kong as a distinct entity in their financial and commercial dealings would require more than vague promises.<br>"

                    "In the beginning, many observers discovered that few Beijing leaders had a realistic and accurate understanding of Hong Kong. Those accustomed to viewing the world from the perspectives of a Chinese middle kingdom or Marxist philosophy seemed to be equally ignorant and self-righteous in their opinions about how a capitalist colony like Hong Kong could best be governed. This worried quite a number of the Hong Kong elite. There was much anxiety, and remedial lobbying (educating) efforts were undertaken by leading figures in the early stage of the negotiations. Fortunately, the leaders in Beijing were wise enough to put those in the know in key positions to deal with the British and Hong Kong representatives so that the damage was not too great.<br>",
                    "<br/>Next, the Hong Kong people were also frustrated because they could not take part in the negotiations affecting their own fate. Both the British and the Chinese claimed that they represented the interests of the Hong Kong people, but in fact they were overrepresented in some areas and inadequately represented in others. Throughout the whole process, they could only traverse the halls in Beijing and London to lobby the two negotiating parties. This they did to their own potential peril, since such actions implied their locus of loyalty and could affect future careers. Had Hong Kong been negotiating for postcolonial arrangements on its own, as many former British colonies have done, the situation would certainly have been different."

                    "<br/><em>Unevenness</em>—In order to account for the discrepancies and discord that might exist in a society operating under two conflicting systems, Peking has stated that the dialectical principle of the &ldquo;unity of contradictions is the basic and most important objective theoretical source of &rsquo;one country, two systems,&rdquo; thus arguing that there is unevenness in the existence and development of things. On the one hand, this interpretation conforms with Mao Tse-tung&rsquo;s belief that &ldquo;contradictions still prevail in a socialist society&rdquo;; on the other hand, it rejects Mao&rsquo;s &ldquo;theory of continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat,&rdquo; proclaiming that two different systems can coexist and that obstacles to socialism do not have to be removed immediately.",
                    "<br/><em>Historicity</em>—Although in 1895 Taiwan was ceded to Japan as a result of its military defeat of the Ch&rsquo;ing government, and in 1842 Hong Kong passed into British hands, both Taiwan and Hong Kong are integral parts of Chinese territory. Peking has linked &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; with Chinese history, saying that it is designed to end the national division and separation caused by the confrontation between the two parties (Nationalist and Communist). &ldquo;One country, two systems&rdquo; has been used by Peking to arouse nationalistic and patriotic sentiment among Chinese, as part of the united &ldquo;frontline&rdquo; for patriotism, for the purpose of achieving the four modernizations and ultimately the reunification of China.<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Realism</em>—The single most important reason for &ldquo;one country and two systems&rdquo; is that socialism is not attractive to and Hong Kong. In exchange for sovereignty, Peking is willing to guarantee their present lifestyles and economic prosperity. For Hong Kong to maintain its status as an international financial centre the capitalist system should be retained. If the current system is changed artificially, its superiority and prosperity will be lost...<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Transition</em>—According to communist theory, human society evolves through stages from primitive communism, slave society, capitalism, socialism, and ultimately to communism. A process of development takes place within each stage. Marx said that socialist society, having been born out of capitalism, still carries tinges of the old capitalist society. Mao elaborated this further by distinguishing between minimum and maximum programs for socialism. Thus, in line with Marxist theory, the current Chinese Communist leadership claims that &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; acts as a &ldquo;historical transition before this country can thoroughly replace the capitalist system with a socialist system.&rdquo; In other words, the two systems will be merged into one after the transitional period.<br>",
                    "<br/><em>Subordination</em>—The scope and definition of the autonomy of Taiwan and Hong Kong will, of course, be decided by the central government in Peking. Governments in Taiwan and Hong Kong will be subordinate governments powerless to declare war, conduct their own defense, foreign affairs, or peace negotiations. Socialism will be the main political system, because the 1 billion people on the mainland will continue to practice socialism. Capitalism will be allowed to exist as a &ldquo;supplement to the development of socialism.&rdquo;<br>"

                    "<br>The model of &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; envisages the co-existence of two distinct legal systems alongside one another. On one side of the border, there is a well established common law system that is based on Western liberalism and the doctrine of separation of powers. The judiciary is the guard- ian of human rights and the rule of law, and enjoys an exclusive power to interpret legislation and declare the common law. On the other side of the border, legal order has been re-established only since 1978. The country is still in the process of seeking a proper model of legal system that befits the characteristics of a developing economic power under a constitution that is shaped by Socialism/Maoism and Chinese history and culture. The Chinese legal system is based on both the socialist system and the civil law system, but it is subject to increasing influence from the common law system in recent years. A major characteristic of the Chinese legal system, as inherited from the socialist tradition, is its rejection of the doctrine of separation of powers. All powers are vested in the supreme soviet, namely the National People&rsquo;s Congress (NPC). As an elected body representing the people, the NPC exercises legislative, executive and judicial powers. The power of final interpretation of law is vested in the legislative rather than the judicial organ. While there is gradual acceptance of the desirability of having a judiciary exercising independent adjudicatory power (as opposed to having an independent judiciary), the judiciary on the Mainland remains a relatively weak institution and the PRC Constitution is by and large not justiciable in courts. Thus, there is a huge ideological gap between the two systems. This gap manifests itself and results in conflicts when the two systems interact with one another. The Basic Law itself provides the best example of the interface of the two systems. In Ma Wai Kwan Davidv HKSAR, Chief Judge Chan described perceptively the nature of the Basic Law as follows:<br>",
                    "<br/>&ldquo;The Basic Law is a unique document. It reflects a treaty made between two nations. It deals with the relationship between the sovereign and an autonomous region which practises a different system. It stipulates the organisations and functions of the different branches of government. It sets out the rights and obligations of the citizens. Hence, it has at least three dimensions: international, domestic and constitutional. It must also be borne in mind that it was not drafted by common law lawyers. It was drafted in the Chinese language with an official English version but the Chinese version takes precedence in case of discrepancies. That being the background and features of the Basic Law, it is obvious that there will be difficulties in the interpretation of its various provisions.&rdquo;<br>",
                    "<br/>&ldquo;Alongside the huge ideological gap and the vastly different stages of development between the HKSAR and the Mainland legal systems lies the great imbalance of political powers between the Special Administrative Region and its sovereign. When there is no clear demarcation of when two systems end and one country begins, and when mutual trust has not been fully established, it is not surprising that attempts were made by both sides to explore and perhaps also to exploit the boundary separating the two systems. This inevitably leads to controversies and conflicts, and is best exemplified by the conflicts arising from the dual nature of the Basic Law as a piece of national legislation of the PRC and as a constitution of the HKSAR. In a way, the first decade of constitutional experience in Hong Kong can be said to be a story of a delicate exploration in an uncharted sea.&rdquo;<br>"

The Square lies at the geographic center of the capital city and just southeast of Zhongnanhai, where the last dynasty&rsquo;s emperors had their hunting park and where the top Communist leaders now work. Beginning with the May Fourth Movement in 1919, Tiananmen has also become a traditional site for popular protests. These protests have often been led by university students, who are especially numerous here because Beijing is the country&rsquo;s preeminent center of higher education.<br/>",
                    "At People&rsquo;s University a &ldquo;Democracy Wall&rdquo; appeared on the evening of April 17. Spontaneous memorial activities took place on other campuses that until now had been quiet. In addition to pasting up eulogies, memorial couplets, and posters, students made speeches, set up symbolic biers, and delivered wreaths to the Square. Some even demanded to attend the funeral. In a single day, ninety-three handwritten memorial couplets appeared at the Beijing University of Science and Engineering."

                    "On April 28, 1988, the BLDC published the draft Basic Law for public consultation. The community response to Article 22 varied. Some regarded it as necessary to ensure the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Others rejected it on the grounds that it was not referred to in the Joint Declaration; that it was unnecessary because Hong Kong had similar laws; or that it might infringe the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people. In particular it was said that subversion was an offense not known to &ldquo;democratic countries&rdquo; and therefore, should not be introduced into Hong Kong. Another major concern expressed in the consultation process was the uncertain nature of the terms &ldquo;undermining national unity.&rdquo;&lsquo;23 Undermining national unity was a criminal offense unknown to both Chinese and Hong Kong law. Hong Kong&rsquo;s reunification was all about national unity, however, and China was not prepared to soften its position on this issue."

                    "The draft Article 22 was amended after this consultation. The amendments were made on the basis of the principle that, &ldquo;The wording of [Article 22] may be amended, but its fundamental spirit should not be changed. The amendments were as follows: 1) The clause &ldquo;subvert the Central People&rsquo;s Government&rdquo; was replaced by &ldquo;treason&rdquo;; and 2) The clause &ldquo;any act of treason, secession, sedition or theft of state secrets&rdquo; was inserted to replace &ldquo;any act designated to undermine national unity.&rdquo; Article 23, (the previous Article 22), was drafted as follows: The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or theft of state secrets. 26 There was no explanation offered as to why these particular offenses were included in Article 23, although it was clear that the amendment took into consideration both the existing Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese laws and China&rsquo;s political concerns. It was a compromise that seemed to satisfy both sides. China was satisfied because both treason and subversion were offenses in its criminal laws, and treason at common law was broad enough to absorb much &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; behavior. China&rsquo;s national security was sufficiently protected by these additional three offenses. The compromise was also acceptable to Hong Kong because subversion and undermining national unity were replaced by treason and other offenses, which were defined with some sort of clarity and also had a long history at common law."

They were disillusioned with the Chinese government and its promises to Hong Kong by the sudden twists and turns of events on the mainland. The sudden outpouring of emotions and political activism among the Hong Kong Chinese, especially the Hongkongese, can be interpreted as a vivid expression of the Hong Kong identity, which in this case was also shared to a substantial degree by those who identi- fied themselves as Chinese. The year 1989 can thus be considered as a milestone in the formation of the local identity among the Hong Kong Chinese."

                    "</br>Lord Willoughby de Broke My Lords, I am fully aware of the great privilege accorded to me in making my maiden speech in this historic House. I trust that I shall not overstep the boundaries of convention which bind maiden speakers, but I share with the noble Baroness her concern for the future of the people and territory of Hong Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>In December 1984, during the debate on the joint agreement with China, my great friend Lord Birkenhead made his maiden speech. Sadly, Robin Birkenhead is now dead but I should like to remind your Lordships of his words. On that occasion he said: &ldquo;we do not have to live, except in our consciences, with the consequences of this agreement; the people of Hong Kong do. Many of them have risked their lives and abandoned everything to escape from Communism. One cannot possibly expect enthusiasm at the prospect of being handed back to a Communist power, however many safeguards are built into their return&rdquo;.—[Official Report, 10/12/84; col. 32.] That was four and a half years ago and today we must address ourselves urgently to the same question.<br>",
                    "</br>Appalling as were the recent events in Peking, they should not have come as a surprise. There had already been a dress rehearsal in Tibet for the brutalities committed in Tiananmen Square. On at least four separate occasions during the past three years—and most recently in March of this year—Chinese troops and police opened fire on and killed unarmed demonstrators. That happened in spite of the fact that freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of demonstration are protected under Article 35 of the Constitution of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. But to its shame the world ignored the warnings from Tibet until minds were wonderfully concentrated by the events on 3rd and 4th June. If the mask had slipped in Tibet, it has now been ripped away and the face of totalitarian China has been exposed.<br>",
                    "</br>That is the power to which we are to hand over Hong Kong and with no more guarantee than the hope that China will abide by the joint agreement. gut after the experience of the past three weeks the people of Hong Kong need more than hope to persuade them that they are not to be delivered defenceless to the mercies of the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army. They need the assurance that if the worst comes to the worst they have in the last resort somewhere to go; an alternative to the bullet and the confession.",
                    "</br>Whereas under the process of decolonisation other Crown colonies were led to or took the path to independence, as the noble Baroness has said, that option was denied to Hong Kong. The right of domicile in the United Kingdom was progressively removed between 1962 and 1981 under the Commonwealth Immigration Act and its subsequent amendments.<br>",
                    "</br>Over the past three weeks the people of Hong Kong have experienced kaleidoscopic emotions: first, of pride and happiness for their fellow countrymen in China as the prospect of greater freedom rose before them; then of anger, shock and compassion; and, finally, of apprehension and fear that what happened in China and Tibet today would happen tomorrow in Hong Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>What is now needed to restore the confidence of Hong Kong is the recognition that we have certain inescapable obligations and that the necessary steps will be taken to meet them. Speedier progress to democratic government, yes; a Bill of Rights, yes. However, they are the icing and what is needed is the cake. They can be no substitute for the fundamental need for an ultimate sanctuary.<br>",
                    "</br>The course advocated by the present Governor, Sir David Wilson, is that we should grant full British passports to the 1.25 million people who currently hold British National (Overseas) passports and to the further 2 million people who are eligible to hold them. I do not believe that such a generous step would mean an unmanageable influx of immigrants from Hong Kong. Their lives are in Hong Kong and they would wish to continue to live there. Paradoxically, the assurance that people could leave would have the effect of encouraging them to stay, for a prison to which you have the key is no longer a prison.<br>",
                    "</br>For my part, I do not believe it quite necessary to go so far as to give immediate right of abode to those 3.25 million who are potentialy eligible in Hong Kong. Certainly those most at risk should have that right and I urge the Government substantially to increase the degree of flexibility in awarding full British passports.<br>",
                    "</br>If Portugal with its smaller population can give to over 100,000 of the citizens of Macao the right of abode in the EC, we can surely give several hundred thousand passports to the people of Hong Kong. I mention the EC because of course by 1992 a British passport will also be a passport to Europe and not all the Hong Kong people will wish to make their home here in the United Kingdom.<br>",
                    "</br>The numbers may seem daunting but this Government have never shirked a challenge. If France has absorbed nearly 2 million immigrants from its overseas territories, we can surely do no less for our subjects in far more deserving circumstances. If Europe&rsquo;s population is increased by a maximum of 1 per cent., that is a tiny price to pay for saving a brave nation from the worst horrors of communism.<br>",
                    "</br>I do not say that Armageddon is coming. However, I say that if it does come we should be prepared. I urge the Government to take the decisions which will satisfy both our honour and our responsibility.<br>",
                    "</br>3.34pm<br>",
                    "</br>Baroness Young—My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Ewart-Biggs, for introducing this important debate today and also by congratulating my noble friend Lord Willoughby de Broke on his maiden speech.<br>",
                    "</br>This debate comes almost exactly one year since we last debated Hong Kong and it is difficult to overstate the change in the situation since that occasion. We have all been appalled by the actions of the Chinese Government over the treatment of the peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square, and no one can ever forget the spectacle on our television screens of the Chinese army literally crushing students who were peacefully trying to express their point of view. We are horrified at the death penalties 233carried out, with more unquestionably to come. Those actions have shocked and appalled the entire world. I express for everyone, I am sure, our deepest sympathy and understanding for the very real concerns of the people of Hong Kong.<br>",
                    "</br>Arising from that dreadful background it is all the more important to consider carefully what the reaction of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government should be to this issue of Hong Kong. I start by placing on record my support for my right honourable and learned friend the Foreign Secretary and the measures that he has already taken against China: a ban on arms sales; a suspension of all scheduled exchanges between Britain and China; a suspension of the visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales; and suspension of all high-level military contacts. I also think that we greatly benefit from my right honourable friend&rsquo;s wise counsel on the situation in Hong Kong and his unwillingness, in my view quite properly, to be pushed precipitously into actions which in many cases have not been fully thought through.<br>",
                    "</br>I am glad that my right honourable and learned friend is to visit Hong Kong shortly. He can then judge for himself the situation on the ground and, above all, can assure the people of Hong Kong that we shall fulfil our obligations and responsibility for the administration of Hong Kong up to 1997. I also place on record my support for the governor, Sir David Wilson, in these difficult times and for the excellent job that he is doing.<br>",
                    "</br>What, then, should we do? The fact is that the historic and geographical realities of the situation of Hong Kong remain. Any viable future for Hong Kong must be dependent upon its co-operation and coexistence with China. Nothing can alter those facts, disagreeable though they may be. Under the lease, 92 per cent. of Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. I recall, as a Foreign Office Minister, commending to your Lordships the Hong Kong agreement—the Sino-British Agreement on Hong Kong. I believe it to be a good agreement. Some people have suggested that we should either scrap it or try to renogotiate it. I believe that that would be a great mistake. We want to see it implemented. Nor is there any evidence that if we did reopen negotiations we would get a better agreement.<br>",
                    "</br>One further positive point remains. It is in China&rsquo;s long-term interests to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. As all speakers have said, we must try to keep up that confidence in Hong Kong. I welcome the proposals that have been made for an increase in democracy. I also welcome the fact that the Hong Kong police force has been strengthened under the control of the Hong Kong Government. I hope that on the tragic situation of the Vietnamese refugees there will be some improvement arising from the discussions at Geneva. That seems to be the case.<br>",
                    "</br>Attention has focused on the question of whether, given the changed situation, we should give an undertaking of the right of abode to some 3.25 million people from Hong Kong. It is a matter of much regret to me that I have not been able to speak, before this debate, to Dame Lydia Dunn, who I 234know is in London, and to hear, first hand, her concerns. Of course we all understand their fears. Who could not? I shall therefore listen with great interest to what my noble friend the Minister has to say this afternoon on the point raised about a further examination, particularly under the nationality Acts, of the position of Crown servants and key business people. I was also interested to read what my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in another place yesterday, when she referred to increased flexibility under the nationality Acts. Both statements I welcome, and I hope that my noble friend can say something further on this matter.<br>",
                    "</br>On the wider issue of whether or not we should give a right of abode to the 3.25 million people in Hong Kong I would like to expand further, but time does not allow. But I say this: it is an immensely difficult issue. The British Parliament must not only consider its obligations to the people of Hong Kong, real and important as those are, but also its obligations to the people of the United Kingdom. Indeed, as the representatives in another place are elected to represent the people of the United Kingdom, their first duty must be to the people whom they represent. In answering this question I believe it must be clear that Britain could not guarantee a right of abode to all these people.<br>",
                    "</br>I believe there is a danger as regards the insurance argument because no government could make that commitment without being prepared to make arrangements to receive for right of abode 3.25 million people. It really would not be fair to the people of Hong Kong, let alone to the people in this country, to pretend otherwise. Those who have to take responsibility often have to say things that they would rather not say and that are very painful and disagreeable. I believe that this is one instance of them. That said, we have all referred to what is called the Armageddon situation. We must profoundly hope and pray that it does not happen. From what my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary said yesterday, I recognise that should that situation arise we shall seek the help of the rest of the world in trying to resolve what will be not only a desperately tragic situation for Hong Kong, but a tragedy for the whole world.<br>"

During the poignant ceremony, participants would light candles, sing pro-democracy songs, listen to survivors’ testimonies and perform Chinese funeral rituals to mourn the people killed in the crackdown. Although most mourners did not participate directly in the movement, the ritualistic practices would serve as their annual reminder of the momentous event.

                    "In 1997, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s ninety-nine year lease with China will expire, and sovereignty of Hong Kong and the governing of its six million people will transfer to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC). Because Hong Kong has become a highly developed economic center, the economic and social implications of this transfer are far-reaching. Business is the soul of Hong Kong; the colony&rsquo;s survival will depend on China&rsquo;s tolerance of a &ldquo;capitalist enclave on its socialist soil.&rdquo; British and Chinese officials entered into talks relating to the transfer in 1982. These talks concluded with the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong (Joint Declaration) in 1984. The Joint Declaration states that Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC and retain a high degree of autonomy as a capitalist system for at least fifty years after 1997.<br></br>",
                    "The Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989, however, dissolved Hong Kong residents&rsquo; confidence in the Joint Declaration, and many began to doubt whether their personal liberties and lifestyles would truly remain protected after the takeover date of July 1, 1997. In 1990, the Basic Law-the law which will govern Hong Kong for the fifty years after the takeover-was promulgated after debate and numerous objections by the members of the drafting committee from Hong Kong. In many respects, the Basic Law is inconsistent with the Joint Declaration and the PRC constitution.&rsquo; Furthermore, in 1997, the Basic Law, as well as future Hong Kong legislation will be subordinate to the PRC constitution, and China will ultimately be in charge.&rsquo; <br></br>",

                    "Although emigration from Hong Kong has steadily increased since 1984, the mixed messages residents of Hong Kong received from the PRC in 1989 and 1990 caused a flood of residents to look for a country to move to before the 1997 takeover. The United States, Canada, and Australia began to receive large numbers of requests for immigration from Hong Kong residents. Some Hong Kong companies even set up overseas offices to satisfy their employees&rsquo; demands for foreign passports. Approximately one in ten Hong KongChinese will have acquired foreign nationality by 1997.&ldquo; Approximately 1.04 percent of Hong Kong&rsquo;s workforce emigrated in 1994 alone.&rdquo;"

                    "Although not everyone who says he will leave will do so, the idea of emigration is pervasive. There have been two Chinese-language comedies on television — Priceless Adventure and Uncle Bill and Aunt Lydia -- that draw on emigration for a theme. In my middle-class neighborhood Chu&rsquo;s Photo Shop displays a poster demonstrating that it can take pictures of the exact style and quality required for Canadian and U.S. visas. At a newsstand nearby I can buy the Hong Kong Standard, which regularly publishes a separate section on Canada. If I buy the South China Morning Post instead, I may come across an ad for fur-lined raincoats, clearly aimed at the Canada-bound. Or I can buy The Emigrant, a glossy Chinese-English magazine, circulation 25,000, which offers tips and background information for would-be emigrants. The pages are filled with display ads from moving companies, a pet transport service, and emigration consultants, who seek out business opportunities and help with the paperwork. A short walk beyond the newsstand, a real-estate office advertises mock-Tudor houses in Britain and a tour agency books flights on Canadian Airlines International, which offers more than twice as many flights to Canada as it did five years ago. At the airport one can buy books like Successful Migrating to Australia and New Zealand -- An Ideal Destination for Migrants and even picture books of Belize, which, until it stopped the program in late 1989 had sold citizenship to several hundred worried Hong Kong residents for a bargain price of $23,800."

                    "I am currently a 16-year-old junior at Hong Kong International School, the only American high school here. I was born in San Francisco, where both of my parents moved from Hong Kong when they were quite young, and I lived there for about six years. Having begun my life in a pretty typical American environment, I wasn&rsquo;t too thrilled as a first grader when my father&rsquo;s business brought our family to Hong Kong. It took me a couple of years before I finally grew accustomed to our new life, and even longer before I gladly accepted the move. For the longest time, I was a nagging daughter, asking at least once a week when we were going to &ldquo;go back&rdquo; to the States. Over the years, however, Hong Kong has really grown on me. Although I&rsquo;m definitely going back to the US for college and, hopefully, my career, I&rsquo;m in no way ruling Hong Kong, this unique place, out of my future.<br></br>",
                    "I&rsquo;d say that the community I live in is quite different, and maybe even a little removed, from what people would call &ldquo;Hong Kong society&rdquo;. My school is pretty much a community in and of itself, rather remotely located in the south side of the island, which is sort of like a suburb of Hong Kong. Many of the students live in this area, as well. A large part of the student body is made up of expatriates from the US. Of course, if you took a sampling of our student population, you&rsquo;d find among them a number of locals, ABCs (American-born Chinese) such as myself, Canadians, and many others from various countries all over the world. Oftentimes I feel that we at the Hong Kong International School live in a world almost separate from that of the rest of the people in Hong Kong, not really being able to know how the locals think and feel. My school has a reputation for affluence, and this contributes to furthering the distance between the greater community and our own. Even so, my community is strongly impacted by what goes on in Hong Kong, especially by the changes taking place regarding the handover that will take place in about two months.<br></br>",
                    "When I was younger, the year 1997, which has carried much significance to the people here for the past decades, always seemed far away. I never expected it to come so soon; I always thought my family would have moved back to the States by the time it arrived. So, I was taken a bit by surprise when, during my recent visit to the US for the Christmas holidays, I found myself feeling solemn among the noise-makers and streamers of the cheerful revelers who welcomed in the New Year. To my ears, their shouts of &ldquo;1997!&rdquo; had a rather ominous ring.<br></br>",
                    "Personally, I&rsquo;m sorry to see Britain go after having established a very successful system in a prospering city. At the same time, I have mixed feelings about China taking over again. On the one hand, as a Chinese person, I should be proud that my &ldquo;mother country,&rdquo; so to speak, is regaining control of something that is rightfully hers. I also have some faith that China will be sensible enough to leave the freedom and autonomy of Hong Kong&rsquo;s people alone. On the other hand, I fear that the plays for power going on right now between locals, Chinese leaders, and a few remaining figures of British authority may contribute to a possible downfall of our flourishing colony. Ultimately, I hope that China will respect the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; agreement and will make decisions that will ensure the stability and continuation of Hong Kong&rsquo;s success.<br></br>",
                    "As the British move out and the Chinese come back in, many people&rsquo;s lives are going to be dramatically affected. There are locals who have emigrated to other countries--mostly to the US, Canada and Australia--and are staying there. There are also many who have recently come back from these countries to live in Hong Kong for the meantime; they had initially left so that a door would be open for them just in case something should happen here that might threaten their safety. However, there are locals who can&rsquo;t afford to leave Hong Kong, who just have to stay here and see what happens.<br></br>",
                    "My situation is a bit different. Having originally come to Hong Kong from the States as an American citizen, I don&rsquo;t have as much to worry about. I can basically leave any time I want to, and I don&rsquo;t plan to remain here permanently, anyway. I&rsquo;m staying here for another year to finish my senior year of high school, and then going back to the US for college. My parents, also US citizens, can leave if they feel the need to. They are both working here, however, and are unsure about their future. At the moment,they are looking at possibly staying for a few more years and then returning to the US, or maybe somewhere else in Asia where business opportunities exist. Like most others in Hong Kong, my family faces an uncertain future, but I hope things will remain stable here when the Chinese take over so that nothing drastic comes to pass."

                    "At this very instant, the neon red digits on a clock in the heart of Beijing are flashing away audaciously, counting down to the second exactly how much time is left until the historic handover takes place. When I went to Beijing this summer, I was chilled to the bone as I stared at these incessantly blinking numbers, and realized there was only one year left. Now there is a mere month left, according to the ‘handover clock&rsquo; recently installed at the local Regent Hotel, and I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to believe July 1st is approaching so quickly...<br></br>",
                    "Just the other day, a reporter from a major Hong Kong newspaper came to the school I attend, qhixh is in a rather affluent area. He approached me and two of my friends with some questions that really started me thinking and helped me to realize some things. Among them, one in particular stands out prominently in my thoughts. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t have a foreign passport and didn&rsquo;t have the means to obtain one, how would you feel about the nearing handover knowing you would have to stay in Hong Kong indefinitely?&rdquo; he asked.<br></br>",
                    "All three of us remained silent for quite a while, not knowing how to answer. As I turned the matter over in my head for a few moments, I realized how fortunate many of us in my community are. We are free from many of the worries and concerns that burden the lives of countless local people. While those like myself have the comfort of knowing that we can leave the territory any time things get out of hand or in the case we are forced to change our way of life, others don&rsquo;t. They have to stay here and comply with whatever China demands. For this reason, I honestly hope that the Chinese will be reasonable and understanding of the needs of the people, although in the past, they have often acted otherwise towards their citizens. I also fear that a loss of freedom of speech and of the press will silence all complaints and opportunities for negotiation, which are presently open and vital to the locals here. Although it probably doesn&rsquo;t affect me directly, the more I think about them, I&rsquo;m becoming increasingly concerned about these issues.<br></br>",
                    "Because the majority of the students in my community are similarly free from much worry about the imminent transition, many of them, sadly, don&rsquo;t have much interest in what is going to happen in the very near future. As one of my friends explained to the newspaper reporter a few days ago, many of us see it nothing more than a significant historic event. Most locals, on the other hand, view China&rsquo;s return as something with the potential to greatly interfere in their everyday lives. Personally, as time approaches that fateful midnight hour, my interest is becoming increasingly stirred up. I wait not only in excited anticipation of the countless festivities and parties --planned years ahead of time--that will accompany the handover, but also with anxious apprehension over how Hong Kong will be reshaped once the fervor dies down.<br></br>",
                    "As somewhat tacky, over-the-top souvenirs flood the shops, along with the an overwhelming number of camera-toting tourists who to pour in daily, I wonder how so many of my classmates can leave the territory for the summer holidays before the end of June, knowing they are missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take part in such a momentous piece of history-in-the-making. As for myself, I am profoundly grateful for the chance to eyewitness this event will bring thousands from around the world to Hong Kong.<br></br>"

The mass media and pro-Beijing organisations are creating a joyful atmosphere for the people of Hong Kong. But are we really happy?<br></br>",
                    "For myself, the end of the colonial rule is certainly great. Even though Hong Kong has been ruled by Britain more than 150 years. I have strong feelings of connection to my motherland. When my family and I were watching the Olympic Games, we concerned ourselves with the performance of China&rsquo;s teams and were proud of their victories. Few Hong Kong people, I believe, would deny their Chinese indentities. In this sense, we are eager to see the reunification. But there are doubts as well.<br></br>",

                    "Why, merely a few days before the sovereignty handover, do so many Hong Kong people still not share the joy? It is because the government-in-waiting is still not able to give us a satisfactory arrangement in terms of our political system and human rights protections.<br></br>",
                    "The news reports of Tiananmen Square now filled with Beijing people taking photos, and waving the five-star PRC (Chinese) flag along with the bauhinia-embellished flag of HKSAR (Hong Kong) seemed ironically funny to me. The streets of Beijing are full of decorations in honour of the handover. However, in Hong Kong, such scenery is not as easy to find. When interviewed by journalists, some Honk Kong people said that the most significant thing about the handover was that they would get a five-day vacation in its honour. Other people also complained the media coverage of handover was &ldquo;too much&rdquo; and decided to travel abroad during this time.<br></br>",
                    "For the businessmen, the handover is a good opportunity. In addition to the summer and Christmas sales, we now have reunification sales in the retail stores. Someone questioned whether it is appropriate and justifiable for the government to spend millions of dollars on the celebrations, while our elderly citizens receive only is about $300 (US) a month, an amount the government has refused to increase.<br></br>",
                    "Academics have warned of the potential for social unrest; this worries me, too. As our community is presented to the world in bubbles of prosperity and happiness, we will experience great disappointment if, after the handover, we are faced with a series of restrictions on our civil liberties, a pushing back of the democratic movement, an unhealthy rise in property prices and an increasing disparity of wealth. However, I hope that Hong Kong people will think more about these things and not bury our heads in the sand.<br></br>"

In fact, the tourist industry here has been extremely successful for as long as I can remember. At present, however, there has been an obvious increase in the number of people walking around the streets carrying cameras and speaking less familiar languages. Most notable has been the increase in the number of Mandarin-speaking people (the languages usually spoken in Hong Kong are Cantonese and English), heralding the arrival of the many more mainlanders to come in the next few years.<br></br>",
                    "The whole atmosphere of Hong Kong is changing, and one can almost sense a different feeling in the air. What I am most impressed with, however, is the attention the international media are giving to Hong Kong. Before the approach of this prodigious event, most people had no idea where Hong Kong was and probably didn&rsquo;t even care that much. Now, the world is being given the opportunity to focus its attention here and learn to a little about a place they never knew much about before.<br></br>",
                    "The whole city is pretty much buzzing right now. The upcoming event is all many people can talk about, and local newspapers just can&rsquo;t print enough material concerning the handover. There has been so much fuss about it that many people have acquired what has jokingly been labelled as &ldquo;handover fatigue&rdquo;. Nevertheless, I have been enjoying the excitement.<br></br>",
                    "The stately skyline has been set ablaze with the colorful lights that decorate the buildings; the streets are adorned with banners. There have been countless special events, shows, concerts, exhibitions, parties, etc., going on every day for the two months that preceded the transition. Some of these mark the sad farewell Britain is bidding the crown colony it fostered for so long. Others joyously proclaim China&rsquo;s proud reunification with its long-lost entity. In either case, strong nationalism exudes from both sides.<br></br>",
                    "Just the other night, I attended a concert given by the English military marching bands, who are due to set sail back to the UK in a couple of days. As the familiar strains of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; reached my ears, I saw the governor Chris Patten as well as many other British proudly singing to the tune. It was a sentimental moment, and I could feel the dignified sadness they were experiencing . These British people are concluding a prosperous rule here, and many are preparing to return to their homes. On the other hand, the glimpses of Chinese performances I&rsquo;ve caught on the news have all been very bright--and a little overly-optimistic in my opinion.<br></br>",
                    "Within my own group of relatives and close friends, &ldquo;celebrations&rdquo; are also being planned. On the night of June 30th, I will be getting together with my mother&rsquo;s side of the family at a relative&rsquo;s house for a big dinner. We&rsquo;ll be watching the fireworks from her balcony and witnessing the handover ceremony on TV. On July 1st, I&rsquo;m eating another big dinner with my dad&rsquo;s side of the family as well as some friends, several of whom have flown over from the States. Many of my friends are doing something similar, while some whom I&rsquo;ve talked to still haven&rsquo;t planned anything yet. I anticipate a smooth transition and hope that nothing very drastic will occur to disrupt Hong Kong&rsquo;s normal peaceful atmosphere. It&rsquo;s only a matter of days until the world will be able to witness this century-long awaited event!<br></br>"

Even though they did not share political fate with the mainland Chinese before 1997, Hong Kong Chinese still had tremendous empathy with their fellow compatriots. To many Hong Kong Chinese, colonial rule, though basically benign and tolerable, was still demeaning and occasionally outrageous. Racial discrimination, though increasingly taking a subtle form, was still an intrinsic feature of colonial rule which constantly reminded the colonized of their common Chineseness. Undoubtedly, communism was repulsive to the Hong Kong Chinese, but the fact that the Chinese Communists had performed the feats of shaking China off from foreign control and building China into a major power in the world had left a strong, albeit paradoxical, impression on them. Still, as Hong Kong was a sanctuary to many people there, Chinese nationalism and anti-colonialism had never been potent forces in shaping the identity of the Hong Kong Chinese.

Nowhere in their thinking was there much room for Hong Kong&rsquo;s local population, whom until recent memory were barred from the clubs, management suites and halls of government.

                    "In early April, we celebrate the Ching Ming Festival. On that day, Chinese people go to the graves of their ancestors with flowers as a memorial to those who have gone before us. In my memories of Ching Ming, it always seems to be raining on this day. Grandma would tell me that these were no mere raindrops; they were the tears of God.<br></br>",
                    "&ldquo;Why would God cry?&rdquo; I once asked her.<br></br>",
                    "“God is moved by the filial piety of these people,” she replied.<br></br>",
                    "Today she remains as superstitious as many traditional Chinese people. Of course, the rainfall that often graces this festival is due to the season, which takes place in the spring. But in the minds of many people, the raindrops are still the tears of God.<br></br>",
                    "In the past few days, Hong Kong was soaked by heavy rains. I don&rsquo;t know whether these were the farewell tears for our last Colonial Governor, Chris Patten, or for the touching moment of the handover. I say this because of a very funny story that Mama just told me.<br></br>",
                    "The other day morning, Mama went to restaurant with her friends to have Chinese tea. After she sat down and gave her order, she heard a woman saying, “What a heavy rain! Of course, even our God is crying for our Governor. We will miss him. Ah...What will be Hong Kong like under the Chinese Communist Party?….” Another woman interrupted, “What ails you? What&rsquo;s wrong with the restoration of the sovereignty by our motherland? I feel good…..” They insisted on their own views and kept on arguing.<br></br>",
                    "The dialogue that took place between these two women in some way demonstrated the two different sensibilities of Hong Kong people. Some are very enthusiastic about the re-unification, while some are doubtful. Most of them, however, are puzzled. I hope the rain will stop soon, so we may walk in brilliant sunshine."

Over the central government offices, gone is the elaborate colonial crest of the lion and unicorn, replaced by China&rsquo;s seal: five stars over a silhouette of the Forbidden City&rsquo;s Gate of Heavenly Peace.

The government refused to acquiesce to demands for a “white bill” (that is, a version with draft provisions that can be amended before the actual legislative process, while the later version, known as the “blue bill,” is the actual draft legislation submitted to the legislature for passage) and instead laid out general principles in a consultation paper that most critics complained was inadequate for serious analysis and discussion.

The demonstrations reflect a reaction to a series of unpopular government actions—not only the government’s handling of the public consultation over Article 23 but also other issues, particularly its management of the public health crisis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).<br></br>",

Schools were closed for six weeks. Restaurants, shopping malls, theaters and other public venues remained eerily empty throughout this period. People donned surgical masks to go out in public; waiters in upscale restaurants wore rubber gloves. Pervasive fear made normal life in Hong Kong impossible. While the SARS crisis was principally a public health phenomenon, many Hong Kong people felt immense frustration with the government’s slow response to the situation."

                    "Since the onset of the Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong’s economy has faced an unfavorable external environment. Financial liquidity in Asia drained away in the crisis and its aftermath. Hong Kong’s link to the U.S. dollar through a currency board arrangement did not improve matters. The Hong Kong dollar appreciated in value along with the strengthening U.S. dollar during 1999–2002. Investment demand for housing collapsed at the same time that the housing supply began to soar. Although nominal mortgage interest rates were kept low in a globally low-interest-rate envi- ronment, the true borrowing cost was high in real terms, with deoation plodding along at 2–4 percent per year (table 3). Households were struggling to pay down their mortgage debts after the housing-market bubble burst. Domestic consumption was shrinking, and the economy was contracting. Hong Kong’s unemployment rate hit record levels, exceeding 7 percent by the end of 2002. The unemployment problem was made worse by the continuous inoow of low-skilled immigrants from mainland China.<br></br>",
                    "Beginning in 2003, signs of economic recovery had appeared. Real GDP in Hong Kong grew at 3.4 percent in 2002:Q3 and at 5.1 percent in 2002:Q4. In late spring of 2003, exports from China picked up very strongly, and cargo movement in Hong Kong ports and airports showed good growth. Thus, the outbreak of SARS hit Hong Kong at a very bad time. Domestic demand collapsed before it had an oppor- tunity to recover from the recession in 2001. Alarmed by the outbreak at the Amoy Gardens and by the news that several foreign businessmen might have contracted SARS in Hong Kong and returned with it to their home countries, WHO issued a travel advisory on 2 April 2003, urging people to postpone nonessential trips to Hong Kong and Guangdong. WHO’s travel warning and the reluctance to travel by air devastated travel and tourism in the Asian region, particularly in Hong Kong. Many companies worldwide banned business travel to infected areas. Restrictions on travelers from infected areas aggravated the situation.<br></br>",
                    "As the SARS outbreak raged on in China, the economic environment in the region darkened as the prospects of the fastest-growing economy in Asia became cloudy. The uncertain outlook prompted the World Bank to predict that output growth in East Asia would fall by almost 1 percentage point in 2003, to 5 percent (World Bank 2003). Analysts and rating agencies also revised their forecasts downward (table 4). On average, private sector analysts estimated that Hong Kong’s output growth in 2003 would be 1.2 percentage points lower than previously expected, which trans- lated to a drop of around HK$15 billion in spending on anal goods and services in the domestic economy. On 9 April 2003, the government announced that the original forecast of a 3 percent real growth rate in GDP would not be met. Doom and gloom hit the region and Hong Kong (pg. 67-68).<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "The SARS outbreak was an unexpected negative shock to Hong Kong’s economy. The most signiacant negative effects were on the demand side. Local consumption and the export of services related to tourism and air travel were severely affected in the short run. Early anecdotal evidence reported in the press indicated that restau- rants and retail outlets were hit hard, with sales dropping by 10 to 50 percent. Land transport declined by 10–20 percent because people stayed home. There was also a 50 percent drop in the use of the Airport Express Line,1 which indi- cated a reduction in air travel. Fortunately, the supply side of Hong Kong’s econ- omy was unaffected. Even though SARS raged through the province of Guangdong, the cross-border manufacturing base was not disrupted. The production and cross- border movement of goods continued to function smoothly, and the global supply chains remained intact (pg. 70).<br></br>"

After reunification, Shanghai threatened to become China’s new financial capital, and people in Hong Kong worried that they would soon be living in “just another Chinese city”; its real-estate markets began a precipitous decline, and restrictions on civil liberties threatened its nominal sovereignty. sars felt like a knockout blow to a city already reeling.<br></br>",
                    "I was in Hong Kong because I edited Time Asia, an international edition of the newsweekly with a staff of sixty-two and bureaus around the region. When sars broke out, we couldn’t work from home—the Internet wasn’t good enough. Instead, we watched from our offices as the green-and-white-roofed Star Ferry boats travelled, empty, across Victoria Harbor. Each afternoon, we waited for the Hong Kong Department of Health to release its numbers. We kept a betting pool, guessing how many new cases there would be. The idea was to get close but not go over; an optimist, I always lowballed.<br></br>",
                    "…The Hang Seng Index, which tracks stocks listed on Hong Kong’s exchange, shed fifteen per cent of its value between January and April. After a prankster falsely suggested that the city was going to be sealed off, some A.T.M.s briefly ran out of cash. Then, as if things couldn’t get any worse, on the first of April, Leslie Cheung, the openly bisexual Cantopop crooner and actor who had starred in “Happy Together” and “Farewell My Concubine,” leapt from the twenty-fourth floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Cheung had always felt like a lucky charm for Hong Kong—a beloved and approachable celebrity we could see drinking in Lan Kwai Fong on any given night. Cheung’s death—he had suffered from depression—darkened our already dour moods.<br></br>",
                    "We didn’t know it yet, but that week—the week of Leslie Cheung’s death—was the point of maximum hysteria and fear. In early April, while we were betting on the number of new cases and wondering about the extent of the coverup, Hong Kong passed its inflection point, with the number of new infections sinking below that of cleared cases. As April turned to May, and warmer days commenced, we looked around and realized that we were still alive.<br></br>"

Whilst massive human rights violations in Hong Kong under Chinese (communist) rule which Hong Kong during the 1990s feared have not materialised after 1997, the autonomy as has repeatedly been promised to the people of Hong Kong by the British and Chinese governments as well  as in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and ultimately the Basic Law of Hong Kong, promulgated by China’s National People’s Congress in 1990 as the prospective mini-constitution of post-colonial Hong Kong, has nonetheless been eroded. The erosion of autonomy has particularly been caused by and manifested in the existence and use of the mechanism laid down in Article 158 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong which vests the power of interpretation of the Basic Law of Hong Kong ultimately in the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, a legislative body of China. Universal suffrage, the cornerstone and ultimate indication of every developed society, continues to be denied the people of Hong Kong, even though it was explicitly promised by the Joint Declaration and which the Basic Law of Hong Kong reiterates as the ultimate aim of governance of Hong Kong."

                    "Former PRC President Hu Jintao has talked and written extensively about democracy, as it is viewed and practiced in China. Here is what he said in a speech celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the NPC, in Beijing:<br></br>",
                    "The people’s congress is responsible to the people and is under the supervision of the people. Through universal democratic elections, it produces the people’s own representa- tives. The people’s congress effectively ensures that people of all ethnic groups in China have democratic elections, democratic decisions, democratic management and democratic supervision, and that they enjoy extensive democracy, freedom and rights under the con- stitution and the law. (Hu Jintao, 15 September 2004)<br></br>",
                    "In this short segment, President Hu mentions ‘democracy’ no less than six times, thereby highlighting the importance of this concept for his audience and for the occasion. It is almost tantamount to a declaration of principle, a constitutive docu- ment defining the liabilities and responsibilities of the People’s Congress. However, what is really meant by ‘democracy’ is not explicitly spelled out here. To discover the real meaning (in practice) of the concept, one has to go to another passage in the same speech by Hu Jintao:<br></br>",
                    "We must promote democracy and ensure that the people are the masters. To have the Chinese Communist Party in power is to lead, to support and to ensure that the people become the masters, to safeguard and to realize the fundamental interests of the majority of the people ... [to ensure this] we must strengthen the party’s governing ability. (Hu Jintao, 15 September 2004)<br></br>",
                    "In other words, to vary an often quoted, but probably apocryphal quip by Lenin, ‘democracy is good, but control is better’. In the Chinese vision of democracy, one can only allow for ‘democratic’ procedures as long as they are guided and kept in check by the real governing instance, the ‘locus’ of power, the Party. Clearly, there is a lack of harmony between the two concepts: ‘freedom’, as ensured by democracy and democratic procedures, and ‘power’, as instituted by, and embodied in, a minority of people who have the obligation to ‘lead’ the people to become ‘masters’ – but of what? The people can only exercise their ‘mastership’ under the guidance of, and in subservience to, the views and dictates of the Party, which itself is controlled by a small number of people in the Central Committee (not even by the 1400 members of the People’s Congress, which itself is under the control of the Party). It is a bit as if one were in a mirror cabinet, where the pictures are reflected, and reflect themselves, everywhere and infinitely, such that it is impossible to localize the ‘original’ and ‘leading’ picture, the one that is the mother and origin of the rest.<br></br>"

                    "[...] I am a researcher into the rule of law in Hong Kong and I am interested in how it can be maintained. I find that the situation of the rule of law is deteriorating and one of the reasons for that is we don’t have a democratic electoral system to put it on a solid foundation. The rule of law is not just judicial independence – yes, this is important and many people emphasis this – but how to ensure judicial independence? You must have sufficient limits on the powers of the executive branch before you can have a good protection of this. And without democratic election the kind of protection will be weaker. As the Hong Kong situation deteriorates in terms of the rule of law we have to find a way to increase these protections. This is why we must have a democratic election. I am not saying that we don’t have a rule of law at the moment – we do – but how to protect it has become the central question when we are under a whole number of challenges. So we need to have a democratic system to sustain the rights that we have properly.<br></br>",
                    "The second thing to say on this is about my own advocacy of civil disobedience, because some people have questioned this on the grounds: how can a law professor tell people to breach the law? This poses questions of what we mean by the rule of law, about the ideal of the rule of law, and what we are struggling for today. This is what Hong Kong people have not understood in the past: the mistaken idea that if you are planning civil disobedience – and therefore planning to breach the law – then you are somehow going against the rule of law. And this is something that the anti-Occupy Central campaign has developed as one of their main points. But the rule of law should not be literally understood as ‘obeying what the law says’. It is rather about whether you have a system of law that can achieve justice, including the political rights and freedoms of the people. So sometimes under certain conditions it is right to breach the law to help us achieve justice. That is the whole spirit of civil disobedience. Other people talking about that may not attract much attention but because I teach law here, at the University of Hong Kong, and am considered to be an expert on the rule of law in Hong Kong, these arguments have been raised over my role in Occupy Central. And this creates an interesting level of theoretical and practical argument within the movement."

                    "Mr President, the public consultation launched today is the preparatory work to commence the &ldquo;Five-step Process&rdquo;. To successfully implement universal suffrage for the CE, we have to complete all the steps in accordance with the legal procedure, of which the most crucial step is to secure the passage by a two-thirds majority of all the Members of the LegCo.  In 2005, the proposal put forward by the then HKSAR Government, though supported by a majority of the public, did not ultimately obtain enough votes in the LegCo, resulting in an impasse in the constitutional development of Hong Kong.  With a pragmatic and accommodating approach adopted by all of us, the 2010 constitutional development proposals were passed by more than two-thirds of all Members of the LegCo, obtained the consent of the CE, and received the approval or record by the NPCSC respectively, and the &ldquo;Five-step Process&rdquo; was historically completed.<br></br>",
                    "Today, we have formally stepped onto the straight road of welcoming universal suffrage.  According to the 2007 NPCSC Decision, the selection of the CE by universal suffrage is a pre-condition for the election of all Members of the LegCo by universal suffrage.  We need all Members here, people across the political spectrum, as well as various sectors of the community to work together to forge consensus. I would like to take this opportunity to urge all Members here, all political parties, as well as the public at large, to adopt an accommodating, rational and pragmatic approach, as well as an inclusive attitude to seek common ground, and with the deepest sincerity to forge the biggest consensus, so that the universal suffrage for the CE in 2017, a common aspiration for all, could be implemented successfully.<br></br>"

The Hong Kong community has become highly divided and polarized, especially during the months preceding the NPCSC’s 31 August 2014 decision concerning the process for nominating CE candidates. At one end of the spectrum, the conservatives wanted to keep the Election Committee from the previous CE election cycles as the nomination committee for the 2017 election and even raise the threshold for nomination (which had been well below half of the committee in previous cycles). At the other end of the spectrum, many people have no confidence in the Election Committee model. So they advocated civic nomina- tion, that is, a person who has secured a certain amount of popular endorsement from the voters becoming a candidate. Another proposal was to have nomination by political parties that will have secured a certain percentage of votes in the LegCo election in 2016.<br></br>",

By contrast, Hong Kong people see “One Country, Two Systems” as a guarantee of their high degree of autonomy, according to which they could run local affairs without intervention from Beijing – including the election of their Chief Executives."

                    "Lines had now been drawn. In the White Paper, Beijing had declared itself the boss, with little said about putting hearts at ease. The Joint Declaration’s twelve articles had become twelve preexisting Chinese principles that “come solely from the authorization of the central leadership,” with little said about the international legal commitments that the Declaration entails.11 As if to clear up any doubt about Beijing’s stance, Chinese diplomats and Foreign Ministry officials would before the end of 2014 begin openly claiming that the 1997 handover had completely fulfilled the Joint Declaration and thereby rendered it “void.”12 Such claims, of course, fly in the face of clear language in the Joint Declaration’s Article 7 that obligates both parties to implement all articles of the agreement. By undercutting the Joint Declaration, Beijing emphasized the NPC Standing Committee’s full authority to interpret or amend the Basic Law as it chooses.

The decidedly unrepresentative Election Committee is described as “an expression of equal representation and broad representativeness.” The White Paper even says that the chief executive must be a person “who loves the country and loves Hong Kong,” a phrase that is seen in Hong Kong as code for “must be a figure in tune with the pro-Beijing establishment.”"

It is not an ethnolinguistic war over ‘pure’ dialects, or a war over English or Chinese medium-of-instruction policies, but a semantic war about words. Who can decide what words mean when opposing sides in a conflict apparently attach completely different meanings to the same concepts? In accordance with the framework laid out in the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the people of Hong Kong are supposed to elect the Chief Executive in 2017 through universal suffrage. However, when the current government presented their proposed framework for political reform, a war over words broke out in the media, and later in the streets of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government, aided by mainland government officials, claimed that the people of Hong Kong would be given a unique opportunity to elect their own leader through a fair and impartial one-person-one vote electoral system. The pro-democracy camp and various student organizations, on the other hand, claimed that the government’s political reform proposal had nothing to do with democracy, because it ruled out civil nomination and because only pre-approved candidates who had to be patriotic and ‘love the country’ [PRC] could run for Chief Executive.<br></br>",

                    "In June 2014, the PRC State Council released a White Paper on the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ policy in Hong Kong. The paper outlined some of the overarching principles that should govern the political reform process in Hong Kong. One requirement, mentioned repeatedly, is that the people who govern Hong Kong must be patriotic: ‘Loving the country [PRC] is the basic political requirement for Hong Kong’s administrators’ (including the Chief Executive, government officials, members of the Executive and Legislative Council, and judges). This requirement was strongly criticized by particularly the judiciary in Hong Kong, which proclaimed their independence from the gov- ernment in public statements. The White Paper also stipulates that Hong Kong must work, with Mainland China, to build a common home for all Chinese; it thereby reinforces the ‘One-Country, One-People, One-Language’ ideology, which has been promoted by the Chinese government since the 1950s (Wang & Ladegaard 2008). A final contentious issue is that government officials “have on their shoulders the responsibility of correctly understanding ... the Basic Law”. In a response paper, the Hong Kong Bar Association points out that the courts in Hong Kong campaign neither can nor will take instructions from anyone as to a definitive ‘correct’ interpretation of the Basic Law."

Not a system that contains a screening mechanism so that two or three anointed candidates are put to the people for so-called ‘one man, one vote.’ I ask people to remember there is no point in having ‘one man, one vote,’ if all we are given to vote from are three puppets.”"

They may not agree with Occupy Central but they think universal suffrage should be supported. So they agree with the goal of the movement, but they disagree with the means, i.e. civil disobedience. But this middle group will not join with the anti-Occupy Central campaign, because they have no demands on the meaning of universal suffrage. So they think we are wrong to occupy the central area, but want to see a substantial form of universal suffrage. We have therefore three sides. We must find a way to reach a consensus in the whole of society so that we can proceed to the future constitutional development."

                    "*792,808 Hong Kong people had cast ballots in the Civil Referendum held by Occupy Central with Love and Peace from 20 to 29 June. It showed that Hong Kong citizens are not afraid of suppression and treasure their freedom of expression. We are very encouraged by the result and would like to express our gratitude to the citizens for their support to Occupy Central with Love and Peace and their trust in the online voting portal established by the Public Opinion Programme of The University of Hong Kong (POP) and Centre for Social Policy Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (CSPS).<br></br>",
                    "In this civil referendum, there were two motions for the citizens to express their views. The first motion is about what electoral reform proposal Occupy Central with Love and Peace should submit to the government. Proposal no. 1, namely the Alliance for True Democracy proposal, was elected by 42% of the voters, received 333,962 votes. Excluding the abstentions and not voted, people who voted for this proposal constitute 46% of the valid votes.<br></br>",
                    "The three proposals on the ballot have altogether received support of 720,284 votes, constituting 91% of the total number of votes. This reflects a strong support of the citizens for proposals with the element of civil nomination, and the government has to respond to the public’s demand. On the other hand, we notice that 72,397 people chose to abstain or not to vote, which constituted 9% of the total votes. The result reflected that certain voters might not fully understand the proposals or did not support them.<br></br>",
                    "Regarding the former, Occupy Central with Love and Peace will continue to do our best to explain the proposals to the community. Regarding the latter, we will, with a humble and open attitude, communicate and seek cooperation with all the organizations and individuals who advocate for the democratization of the Nominating Committee. Together we will continue to fight for a genuine universal suffrage.<br></br>",
                    "The result of the second motion in the civil referendum is clear and unequivocal.  696,092 citizens (87.8% of the total voters) believed that if the government proposal does not meet international standards allowing genuine choices by electors, the Legislative Council should veto it. 59,897 votes said that LegCo should not veto it, constituting 7.6% of the total. There were 36,487 votes of abstention and not voted, constituting 4.6% of the total.<br></br>",
                    "The result indicates that although Hong Kong people may have diverse views on the electoral reform proposals, they have a clear bottom line – other than one person, one vote, universal suffrage should allow people from different backgrounds to enter into the election thus providing truly meaningful choices for the voters. Those who claim that even a non-genuine universal suffrage should be “accepted temporarily” have been defeated by the poll results."

The first summarized five months of consultations regarding electoral reform. The second was the HKSAR chief executive’s report to the NPC Standing Committee on the need for reform.14 Together, these papers put forward the misleading claim that “mainstream opinion” (or “relatively more views”) favored the outcomes that Beijing had called for (and would later require) on issues such as the patriotism of the chief executive and the Nominating Committee’s makeup, procedures, and powers. Scrutiny later revealed that more than nine-tenths of the material conveyed in the consultation report consisted of en bloc submissions by elements aligned with the government.15 In January 2015 came first a report on the Umbrella Movement protests and then the launch of the second round of democratic-reform consultations. Nowhere has there been any attempt to correct the earlier misrepresentations of Hong Kong opinion or to address public concerns in a serious way.<br></br>",
                    "The NPC Standing Committee embraced the chief executive’s report. Instead of the straight approval or disapproval specified in the 2004 interpretation, the Standing Committee imposed severe restrictions along with its approval.17 A requirement to mod- el the Nominating Committee on the Election Committee ensured that nominations will remain in the hands of unrepresentative and establishment-favoring elites. A 50 percent (as opposed to a 12.5 percent) threshold for nomination guaranteed that democratically minded candidates (known locally as “pan-democrats” to signify that they come from a range of parties and groups) would have no chance of getting through the door. As if to nail this down, there was also a requirement that the number of those nominated to be chief executive cannot exceed three. Like the White Paper, the decision worries about sovereignty and security, and stresses that the chief executive must love “the country” (that is, China) and Hong Kong.",

At the end of August, the NPCSC decided that the composition, the number of members and the method of formation of the nomination committee for 2017 will be the same as (and not just designed with reference to) the Election Committee in 2012, and each candidate will need the endorsement of over 50% of the members of the nomination committee, which is much higher than the 12.5% that was adopted for nomination in the previous Election Committee.<br></br>",
                    "This NPCSC decision is more conservative than the community had expected. Not only does it exclude any possibility that a candidate favoured by the pan-democrats will be successfully nominated, it also leaves little room for the middle ground options that had been discussed in Hong Kong during 2013 and earlier in 2014. The NPCSC decision leaves the pan-democrats with limited choices: either use their representation in LegCo to vote down the electoral legislation that the Hong Kong government would introduce to implement the NPCSC decision (something the pan-democrats could do if they stuck together because the legislation will need a two-thirds majority in LegCo to pass the proposal for constitutional reform), or take the issue to the streets."

                    "Much of the debate about ‘democracy’ is reminiscent of how the term was used in the former Eastern block of Europe. In the Soviet Union, much was made of the notion of ‘democratic centralism’, as defined by Lenin, and realized in the ‘people’s democracies’ popping up everywhere following the end of WWII in the East of Europe and several places overseas – one wonders if this is the kind of ‘democratic’ model that Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping are thinking of, when they say they are pursuing a Chinese type democracy?<br></br>",
                    "Centralism’, even if called ‘democratic’, implies control: things have to be organized by, and in accordance with the views of, the ‘center’ (read: the powers that be). Furthermore, such control can be either direct or indirect; in the latter case, one has to be sure that the people on the intermediate levels are behaving ‘correctly’: control has to be extended downwards, so that even the popular vote becomes representative of the center’s viewpoints. Accordingly, the Hong Kong 2017 Chief Executive election, even when based on the ‘universal suffrage’ enshrined in the Basic Law of the SAR, is not envisioned in the same way by the central government and by the pro- democracy opposition, the people supporting Occupy. The difference, and the resulting divergent interpretations of ‘democracy’, turn around the question whose interpretation is the more correct one; in practice, this boils down to questioning the degree to which the elections are controlled by the PRC Central Government. <br></br>",
                    "Doesn’t then President Xi’s claim, cited above, imply that a ‘democracy’ of the aforementioned Chinese type has to be imposed wherever the Chinese control the situation, irrespective of the wishes and claims of the people they control? (The case of Tibet is an egregious example).<br></br>",
                    "But why can’t the Mainland Chinese see this, when it is so patently obvious to millions of their compatriots in Hong Kong? One (perhaps the main) reason is that the very Constitution of the PRC has, in its Article 3, the words: “The state organs of the People’s Republic of China apply the principle of democratic centralism” (italics in original); and, according to Lenin, this principle is realized as “freedom of discussion, but unity in action” (Lenin 1901/1902). But what is this freedom worth, if the only action that is allowed is the one controlled by the ‘center’? The principle has been inculcated in the minds of several generations of Mainland Chinese, and this may explain their failing ‘(in)sight’.<br></br>"

                    "Eighty-seven rounds were fired that night, and many more in the ensuing 79 days of demonstrations in three areas across the city. Umbrellas, an everyday object that Hongkongers are accustomed to carrying around because of the wet subtropical weather, took on a new meaning. The so-called Umbrella Movement brought Hong Kong to a virtual standstill: Harcourt Road became a patchwork of tents, umbrellas, and reading nooks, even including a library. Protesters swept the road, took turns teaching one another in makeshift classrooms, and pooled resources for food and water. Newspaper estimates put the number of protesters crammed onto this downtown thoroughfare at more than 100,000 at any given time. Causeway Bay and Mongkok had similar campsites, each a distinct mix of personalities and ages, united by a shared dream of genuine democracy. Protesters conjured a massive display of peaceful disobedience, cleaning the streets and sharing resources as the days wore on. I was 16 when the Umbrella Movement broke out, but Brian Leung was a second-year student at the University of Hong Kong. “You saw a lot of your peers — like Nathan Law — become the leading figures of a city-wide movement,” he recounts. “It was spectacular.” This built a very strong sense of community among Hong Kong’s young people, many of whom were previously apolitical. And, as Brian explains, the resilience and togetherness witnessed in those autumn months built “a very strong collective memory” among democrats in Hong Kong’s society"

With the emergence of a new generation of advocates, the pro-democracy movement’s spirit was evolving, from its non-confrontational beginnings into a more disruptive resistance embodied by the new Umbrella Movement."

We have also at times tried to negotiate with demonstrators occupying roads so vehicles can go through, but we also respect the demonstrators’ choices if they insist on staying on the roads. The people on the streets see themselves as bargaining chips who can help us negotiate with the government."

That is, people only cared for their livelihoods, and their common dream was to achieve economic success. The driving spirit which has long made HK people proud of themselves is built on hardship endurance, self-reliance, and an attitude of being hard working. The HK tycoon Li Ka- shing, for instance, has long been youths’ admired and emulated figure. It is said that the Umbrella Movement is a turnaround and testifies an awakening of HK youths’ social and political consciousness.<br></br>",

They urged students to withdraw from the occupied areas for the sake of their own safety and to now end the occupation at a timely point. One convincing argument from these sympathizers is that withdrawal at this point could gain a greater acknowledgement from the HK general public and avoid a massive physical suppression from the authority in view of how the 1989 movement ended."

Second, the student federation leaders who took part in the dialogue are not free agents either. They represent only one of the student groups, and other actors are involved.

Rather, it means that protesters need to have a strategic understanding of the weak and strong points of the state’s structure. The Umbrella Movement came and went without compelling any concessions partly because the Hong Kong government was recalcitrant, but also partly because protesters stuck to an inherently unsustainable form of protest. It is true that the disruptive action of occupying busy streets captured the world’s attention. Yet after the initial show of people power on September 28 and 29, most demonstrators were un- ready to stay for the long haul. The most committed camped out in the streets, and the less committed had to make a living. The uncommitted gradually lost their patience, and the antagonistic grew more hostile. Had police and thug violence not repeatedly roused enough public anger to drive supporters back to the occupy sites, the Umbrella Movement would have folded sooner than it did."

Civil disobedience is about breaking the law in a limited way through peaceful, non-violent means to fight for justice. As it is not the goal of civil disobedience to damage the rule of law, those engaging in it must have the courage to bear the legal consequences. The three initiators of OCLP and some of our supporters have decided to surrender to police tomorrow (3rd December) to demonstrate the spirit of this kind of commitment and responsibility.<br></br>",

To surrender and bear the legal consequences is to respect the rule of law. Surrendering is not an act of cowardice, it is the courage to act on a promise. To surrender is not to fail, it is a silent denunciation of a heartless government."

This intuitively makes sense: Hong Kong’s stock index is one of the largest in Asia, and after last year’s Shanghai index collapse, it remains vitally important to China. Similarly, if a protest threatens to hurt Hong Kong’s economy, the government is more likely to concede policies to preserve economic prosperity and investor confidence.<br></br>",

The government didn’t budge on its policies, demonstrating that the Chinese government was able and willing to sit out a three-month protest. So unlike previous protests in Hong Kong that affected the economy, the lack of an even marginal effect on the economy was the main reason that the 2014 protest didn’t succeed. Without affecting the retail and business sectors of Hong Kong’s economy, the protesters could not pressure the Chinese government to change its policies; as long as the economy remained stable, Beijing had little incentive to grant suffrage to Hong Kong residents.<br></br>",
                    "[...]<br></br>",
                    "For future protests or attempts for suffrage, the business sector is key. The Chinese government can afford not to care about a widespread protest by students and the general public. To shift government policy, then, future protestors need to shake investors’, visitors’, and private citizen’s confidence in the government’s ability to control the economy. By rattling business owners, protestors could reach and thereby pressure policy change at the government level through its economic leaders, who would invariably have more bargaining power. Should a future protest actually cut into Hong Kong’s economy, suffrage might finally be granted."

Furthermore, as expressed by several commentators, the fact that the movement was almost totally unbloody and mostly non-violent compared to what had happened some 20 years earlier in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, inspires hopes that some things did change, and that (as some local and foreign newspapers have expressed it), “Hong Kong will never be the same after Occupy.”"

With no extradition agreement between Taiwan and Hong Kong, there was virtually no hope for Chan to stand trial in Taiwan. Moreover, under Hong Kong’s existing extradition law, Hong Kong can only exercise its China-blessed limited power to enter into extradition agreements with jurisdictions “other than the Central People’s Government or the government of any other part of the People’s Republic of China.” As a result, no extradition agreement can be entered into with China under Hong Kong’s existing law. That preclusion is regarded as a firewall shielding Hong Kongers from the jurisdiction of China. Of more pertinence to the murder case in Taipei is that the firewall provision also precludes the Hong Kong government from entering into any arrangement that would bring Chan to justice in Taiwan — unless Taiwan is considered a jurisdiction outside China"

A case in point is a homicide case that caused extensive public concern last year. In this case, a Hong Kong resident suspected of murdering another Hong Kong resident in Taiwan has returned to Hong Kong, but the request for sending him to Taiwan for trial cannot be processed due to the limitations of MLAO and FOO (both ordinances stipulate that they are not applicable to any other parts of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”)). As a result, the court of Hong Kong could only handle the suspected money laundering offences committed by the suspect in Hong Kong, leading to widespread public concern. Apart from the victim’s family who was grief-stricken and wrote repeatedly to and met with HKSARG officials expressing grave concerns about injustice caused by the system’s loopholes, there have also been doubts in the community against the Government’s commitment to combating serious cross-boundary crimes. Having thoroughly reviewed MLAO an FOO, the Government considers that the two ordinances must be amended promptly to plug their loopholes and to protect public safety."

However, lawyers and politicians from across the political spectrum in Hong Kong have proposed multiple other viable solutions which will ensure that Chan faces justice. These should be seriously considered by the Hong Kong government as interim solutions, as this will give more time for further consultation on the wider issue of the supposed “loophole” in existing extradition legislation.<br></br>",
                    "Turning to the second pretext for the proposal, it is absurd to state that the handover negotiators accidentally left a “loophole” in the extradition legislation because they did not have time to consider the desirability of an extradition agreement with China. The existing arrangement does not leave a loophole, but rather erects a necessary firewall to ensure that Hong Kong’s judicial independence remains intact. I was foreign secretary in the run-up to the handover: negotiators from both China and the UK made a conscious decision to create a clear divide between the two systems so that the rule of law remains robust. You can verify this by looking at archival documents in the National Archives (for example, FCO 40/3774; FCO 40/3775; FCO 40/2595)."

In about four days, you will have been in our lives for six months now. It’s really been a wonderful and happy time for us both. Mom’s maternity leave ends on Friday, so we won’t all be at home all day with you anymore. But it was really nice while it lasted. Of course we will spend the rest of our lives together as a family, but these six months being with you nearly every moment has been really special and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.<br></br>",
                    "Right now, it’s 3 a.m. and I’m sitting on a footbridge that connects the Hong Kong legislative council building to an office building. It offers a great vantage for the protests that are starting and will continue over the next few days against an impending extradition bill that would allow the mainland Chinese government courts to compel the HK courts to send people in Hong Kong to China to be prosecuted. Of course, it doesn’t sound like a really big deal on the surface, but it would allow courts in China (which are not transparent and do not follow a clear rule of law) to persecute people here for political reasons. So for example, if one day you are in Hong Kong and decide to exercise your right to express your political opinions, a court in China could come up with a reason (valid or not) to have you tried there, and the HK government would then be expected to deliver you to that court. This type of agreement erodes the autonomy of Hong Kong, which is supposed to be a completely separate political system until 2047.<br></br>",
                    "By then, you will be 28 years old, and I’m afraid there might not be as many rights available to you as there are to Hong Kongers at present. You may not be able to have a say in your government, speak freely about whatever you want, or be able to practise whatever you religion you like. Right now, the mainland Chinese government is rounding up religious practitioners and ethnic minorities such as Muslims, Uyghurs, and Christians and putting them in concentration camps. We don’t know what might happen in the future, but we remember what happened in the past and can see what’s happening right now. So that’s why I’m here, when I’d rather be at home with your mother in bed, ready to wake up at a moment’s notice and go to your room in case I hear you wake up and cry.<br></br>",
                    "Of course, we are so much luckier than most people in Hong Kong. Although you were born here in a very nice, clean, and safe hospital (practically for free!), you are already an Australian citizen, and we will be registering you with the US consulate tomorrow morning for your first US passport and social security number. You have a lot of options. One day you might live in America, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, or anywhere else you might want to go if you have the desire and the talent to make it happen. By the time you read this letter, maybe we will already be living somewhere else. Maybe even in China! So if things ever get bad here in Hong Kong, we will be safe and can be with our family elsewhere. This is not an option for most people in Hong Kong. So while I want you to be able to live here in the future if you want, I think it would be disingenuous to say that I’m here, on this footbridge, for you. Your mother, and definitely your grandparents, all think that the best thing I could do for you, my beautiful son, is to stay at home. And maybe they’re right. It’s hard to ever be sure about these kinds of things because all sides might have a valid point.<br></br>",
                    "I have to admit that before I left the house tonight to walk to Admiralty, I went into your room to look at you asleep in your crib and tell you that I love you. Maybe that’s a little melodramatic, especially because just last week I left you and your mother at home to go to a bar to watch Liverpool win the Champions League final, but I am a bit scared too. The last time I came to a protest like this was 5 years ago, about six months after your mother and I first met. It was October, right before the beginning of the Umbrella Movement. I had originally come by just to support my students who were protesting for their right to true universal suffrage. I didn’t really think it was my fight per se because I’m not from Hong Kong. I spent most of my time there taking pictures, cleaning up garbage and sorting out the recycling. Then it got really crowded and I ended up getting teargassed by the police. It was very scary, totally unexpected. I ran away when I saw the smoke and heard the explosion of the tear gas canister, but the next thing I knew, I was on the ground unable to breathe. My eyes stung and my skin felt like it was on fire. Luckily, there were some well prepared volunteer medics on the scene who poured water over me. They were so heroic. I was and am so grateful to them.<br></br>",
                    "I remember walking through Tamar Park afterwards and seeing kids crying in shock. I was soaking wet and not in the best condition myself. I felt so defeated, and I felt so bad as I walked away and the protesters there watched me. I could sense their disappointed understanding that I had had enough. I went back to your mom’s place to take a shower, and everything smelled like pepper. I distinctly remember the straps on my backpack smelling acidic too. The images of kids being tear gassed was all over the news. I don’t know if I have ever felt as hopeless as that moment.<br></br>",
                    "The next morning, I woke up to go to campus but all the roads were empty. No cars or buses at all. I was confused and went online to find out what was going on. Only then did I find out that after we had gotten tear gassed, thousands and thousands of Hong Kong people took to the streets to protest the unnecessary violence. They ended up occupying major thoroughfares throughout Hong Kong—hence the absence of any traffic on the road. These occupations became a full-on political movement, and it brought the city to a standstill. And for a few months at least, the impossible seemed possible.<br></br>",
                    "The next few months were so beautiful. Your mother and I were falling more and more deeply in love, and we witnessed something miraculous with the Umbrella Movement. It was like seeing a meadow in full bloom, a spontaneous orchestra of sounds in sync to a new song that would only ever be heard once. And it was the first time I ever felt like I was at home—being a part of something bigger than myself with people who wanted me there and to whom I could contribute something meaningful. Of course it couldn’t last forever. But beauty is by definition fleeting.<br></br>",
                    "So, that’s why I’m here (don’t worry though, this time I’m hanging out near the news camera crews: good views and less likely to get gassed!), even though I’d rather be home with you. Because I’m grateful for what Hong Kong has given to us. We are a family because of Hong Kong and its people. I don’t know what the future holds for us or Hong Kong. Maybe our fates are intertwined, or perhaps Hong Kong will one day be just a distant memory to you—the place where your parents met and you were born but only seen in photos and heard about in stories. But at least now you know that you were born from something beautiful and that I wanted to fight for its memory while we still could.",

Car-space became people-space as crowds flooded the streets, filling sidewalks, overhead pedestrian bridges, and alleyways with an ocean of black T-shirts and dark hair. Here, in a city where space comes at a premium, a “sea of black” — as characterized by so many — was created. The images that emerged from these marches captured an intensity of energy and a sense of togetherness that was born in the tight corridors of space winding around high rises. Two million voices coming together as one."

                    "I walked from the pier to Nathan Road, the main thoroughfare in the area, where I met my friend Benny, a reporter for Nikkei Markets, who was standing in front of a convenience store in a gray T-shirt and denim shorts. He gave me a hug and a rainbow-colored umbrella from 7-Eleven—a protester favorite because it has a hard metal tip for self-defense. I hadn’t seen Benny since I’d moved to Beijing two years ago, but we had only a few minutes to catch up before a battalion of police officers down the street hoisted a black flag, signaling tear gas, and fired the first round.<br></br>",
                    "“Move!” Benny said, pulling me onto the sidewalk. Swiftly, seamlessly, and by some collective instinct, the crowd parted, making way for a line of younger protesters. Snaking down the length of Nathan Road in single file, they formed a human supply chain in order to transfer resources—umbrellas, masks, saline—from one end of a demonstration to another. A protester at the far end of the chain began to flap his hands above his head, imitating a sparrow, which prompted others down the line to copy the motion. This was one of the hand signals that activists had developed to aid communication, Benny explained. Drawing circles around the cheeks was a request for a face mask, peace signs were pliers, and sparrow hands were helmets. Seconds after the message was delivered, a yellow hard hat floated down the chain like a buoy.<br></br>",
                    "The human chain epitomized the strategy of the protests: “Be water,” a phrase from Bruce Lee’s martial arts philosophy that encourages resilience in the face of obstacles. Whereas the Umbrella Movement of 2014 stubbornly occupied the city’s streets and landmarks, today’s protesters have adopted guerrilla tactics. When resources are needed, a human chain materializes quickly. When the police advance, it dissipates, reappearing elsewhere. Logistical information is shared through Telegram, an encrypted messaging app; posters and leaflets are distributed using the iPhone AirDrop function, which leaves no digital trace; and real-time updates are crowd-sourced on HKmap.live, a mapping tool that can be marked up with icons: a dog for police, a dinosaur for special tactical squads, a white speech bubble for tear gas.<br></br>",
                    "Unlike the Umbrella Movement, whose organizers were aggressively persecuted, these protests are anonymous and leaderless. There are no figureheads to target and imprison. Decisions are made through an egalitarian and chaotic process of digital democracy, often through a voting mechanism on the online forum LIHKG, Hong Kong’s version of Reddit. Someone floats an idea; it gains traction; and a group of people come together to implement it. The official protest anthem, “Glory to Hong Kong”—now blasted daily on speakers, sung by choruses in malls, and played by street accordionists—was created in this manner. A local pop-rock musician who goes by the pseudonym “Thomas dgx yhl” posted a version of the score, inspired by both “The Star-Spangled Banner” and Vivaldi, on LIHKG, then developed the lyrics from the feedback he received.<br></br>",
                    "Responsibilities in the movement are shared widely, allowing for broad participation across diverse sectors of society. Everyone chooses a role to play. I noticed that many of the younger protesters—kids no older than thirteen—stood near the back of the chain, supporting their older, more physically capable counterparts on the front lines. Volunteer medics in bright-yellow vests roved the streets with first-aid kits to treat the injured. Restaurant owners opened their doors to those seeking food and safety. Behind the scenes, lawyers offered their services pro bono; graphic designers created and distributed artwork; and drivers transported people to safety."

                    "On Monday, the anniversary of Britain’s handover of Hong Kong to China, huge numbers of pro-democracy protesters marched peacefully through the city. Late in the day, a large group of demonstrators from the mostly leaderless movement broke off and faced off against riot police at Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building. Eventually, they smashed their way into the building and swarmed inside, damaging fixtures and equipment, tearing down portraits, spray-painting slogans and graffiti, and occupying the building for a short time. Police eventually responded with force, and protesters vacated the building. The development is a new chapter in the history of Hong Kong protesters’ defiance toward China, and authorities in Beijing wasted no time in condemning the “serious illegal acts” that they said might lead to a breakdown in the social order."

An armed mob of triad members dressed in white indiscriminately attacked civilians on streets with steel rods and rattan canes, before attacking passengers in nearby Yuen Long station including the elderly, children, black-clad protesters, journalists and lawmakers. At least 45 people were injured in the incident, including a pregnant woman. The attack happened following an anti-extradition bill protest earlier that day in Sheung Wan, a district on Hong Kong Island.<br></br>",

The police stood idle at a nearby police station and no arrests were made that night. The police force&rsquo;s inaction, as well as mounting evidence of corruption and misconduct by the Hong Kong police, led some citizens to accuse the police of collusion with the mob, failing in their duty to protect the public.<br></br>",

                    "But Article 14 also states that the Hong Kong government may ask for “assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster relief.” With a chief executive chosen by a 1,200-person selection committee that generally defers to Beijing, the central government in China can easily direct the local government to request PLA assistance.<br></br>",

Hong Kong people, with access to resources and their own creativity, outdo themselves. A similar banner will appear on the face of Lion Rock.

Dressed in improvised armour—hard hats, goggles, masks, cellophane and umbrellas—they prepare to face riot police. Makeshift barriers, bricks and bottles meet with police tear gas—more than 1,800 canisters and counting—and rubber bullets. Hand signals and Telegram groups round out their arsenal.<br></br>",
                    "The earnestness of many protesters is seen in their actions. While destroying symbols of oppression in the Legislative Council chambers, protesters leave coins to pay for cans of soda. A bespectacled teenager places a traffic cone over a tear gas canister, before dousing it with water. It is a battle between many Davids against the giant Goliath, with kids using homemade tools. <br></br>",
                    "“Be Water” is to today’s protesters what Cui Jian’s “Nothing to My Name” was to the activists of 1989. It is, however, more hopeful and perhaps more effective. Faced with overwhelming power, protesters must adapt to any situation.<br></br>",

                    "Not only young protesters improvise. As in Beijing, where art students sculpted the Goddess of Democracy and medical students treated hunger strikers, in Hong Kong, people from all walks of life participate and apply their trades when possible. A Cathay Pacific pilot introduces his passengers on a Tokyo-to-Hong Kong flight to the peaceful protest at the airport, as well as the now ubiquitous chant, “Hongkongers, add oil!” Lawyers, civil servants, airport personnel, medical staff, teachers and accountants all come out to protest, just like the many segments of society that demonstrated in China.  <br></br>",
                    "People leave fare cards and coins at MTR turnstiles so protesters can ride without having to pay or be identified. Thirty years ago, students from all over China travelled for free to join the demonstrations in Beijing. Indeed, many of the protests are orchestrated by the young, as were those in Tiananmen Square. In the Hong Kong protests, everyone is assigned a task, and litter is collected afterwards. However, unlike 1989 and the Umbrella Movement of five years ago, no one is in charge, though unity is a guiding principle. "

Soft-liners such as the Neo Democrats have organised protests to urge reform of the Basic Law and for Hong Kong people to come first in the allocation of resources. Hard-liners such as Hong Kong Indigenous and Civic Passion have agreed to adopt violent clashes with the authorities and mainlanders. They also see claiming independence is a way of forcing the Chinese government to give genuine universal suffrage to Hong Kong. Furthermore, some of them, such as the Hong Kong National Party, have advocated establishing a “Republic of Hong Kong” to take back sovereignty from China. <br></br>",

Based on their historical connection, the position of the traditional pan-democratic parties is perhaps representative of political sentiments toward China. In terms of “anti-China” explanations, the democrats claim that they are “patriotic” as they supported the reversion of Hong Kong’s sovereignty from Britain to China, and have a strong commitment to China’s political, social, and economic development. Many traditional democrats identify with “cultural, ethnic, and historic” China rather than the CCP regime.<br></br>",

Many of them take a more critical attitude towards mainlandisation and the Beijing government and emphasise that Hong Kong people are responsible for protecting the core values and interests of Hong Kong only. In the face of rising political intervention by China, they are sceptical of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle because it cannot eliminate control by Beijing and separate the mainland and Hong Kong. From the localist perspective, the Chinese government is attempting to invade Hong Kong and weaken Hong Kong’s identity. The makes localist claim that they are protecting local identity and showing hostility towards the Chinese government and mainlanders.

Ironically, this sense of stronger resistance has resulted in a vicious cycle: Beijing steps up intervention in Hong Kong affairs while society develops stronger anti-China sentiment followed by localism. However, the HKSAR government has not taken any initiative to address the root of the problem, so Hong Kong can be expected to witness more intense clashes like the Mong Kok Riot. With Hong Kong people becoming more supportive of localism, the political gap between China and Hong Kong will widen. There are two possible ways to deal with this situation. On the one hand, the Chinese government could accommodate the dissatisfaction of Hong Kong people by heeding calls for constitutional reform, in particular the introduction of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive and Legislative Coun- cil elections, thus narrowing the gap. On the other hand, China could exercise more political intervention to force Hong Kong society closer to Chinese values. No matter which path is selected, it has to be acknowledged that China-Hong Kong relations have entered a new stage that prompts reflection on the future of Hong Kong after the “One Country, Two Systems” policy ends in 2047.<br></br>"

                    "It bears repeating that the protest movement’s central five demands are astonishingly humble. Its participants first mobilized around a single ask: that the local government withdraw an ill-conceived extradition bill that would have exposed Hong Kongers to China’s opaque legal system. When Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam responded with a police crackdown, protesters cohered into a movement: They began to demand an investigation into police violence, that the government stop calling the protests “riots” (which exposes protesters to rioting charges, punishable by up to 10 years in prison), amnesty for detainees, and the free elections long promised by Beijing.<br></br>",
                    "These demands are hardly radical. Polls show that they’re supported by a decisive majority of Hong Kongers. This undercuts the Chinese Communist Party’s dishonest rationale for the new national security law, which is that the protest movement somehow represents separatism or even terrorism. In reality, Hong Kong’s present crisis is wholly a creation of the state’s refusal to engage with the people’s concerns—and its decision to, instead, bring violence against them."

While victories have been rare, these movements have shaped the cycles of optimism and anguish that have been integral to the crystallization of the Hongkonger identity that emerged from this undemocratic yet open society. I am part of what Financial Times correspondent Benjamin Bland has labeled Generation HK in his book of the same title: the children raised to adulthood in the SAR, the babies born in the blurry threshold of pre-and-post 1997, the teenagers and 20-somethings who laid their lives on the line in the heat of 2019. With no memories of a British Hong Kong, and no attachment to China, mine is the generation that most adamantly regards itself as “Hongkongers”— a term added to the Oxford English Dictionary after the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement brought the city to a 79-day standstill in 2014.&rdquo;"

Increasingly, that has felt impossible. Sitting on the fault lines of two worlds, trying to weave together a kinder and more plural story with the messy threads of my own personal life, experience and biases, as two old dudes in suits — one with bright, orange hair and another jet black — threaten to rip the whole intricate stitching apart."

                    "But for others, particularly younger people in Hong Kong, frustration flared into anger. The more the Party tried to force Hong Kongers to buy into its narrative of a united, rising China, the more they rejected it. I saw the hot flashes of anger everywhere. At soccer games, people booed the national anthem that I had happily sung during the Beijing Olympics ten years earlier. They blamed soaring housing prices and unemployment on the influx of mainland immigrants, who were perceived as instruments of the Party’s effort to assimilate the local population and erase its culture. The rhetoric used to describe mainlanders became laced with the xenophobic undertones I associated with far-right nationalism. Speaking Putonghua with young people today, a local activist warned me, was like “waving the red flag in front of a bull.” Being a Hong Konger and being Chinese, once complementary, were now mutually exclusive."

Nearly two dozen people—frontline protesters, Hong Kongers living abroad, students—sent back messages detailing their thoughts. Some were succinct (“We are not Chinese,” one 40-year-old man wrote), while others sent lengthy paragraphs. One related his sadness that his young son would grow up to see a city fundamentally different from the one that he experienced; another said she thought Hong Kong’s films, which blend humor and traditional Chinese themes, best represented the territory; a man in his 20s talked about recently becoming enraptured with Hong Kong history and digging through old maps of the territory; some poked fun at the stereotypes of Hong Kong people as buttoned-up workaholics focused on money.<br></br>",

This demonstrator spoke of being deeply moved by protesters helping one another with supplies and organization over the past months: “How can you not love this place when you see people unselfishly helping each other?”"

And now, this place that once protected student protesters had summoned the police against the anti-communist campus protesters. As the values that make Hong Kong distinct from China have come under threat, being from Hong Kong stands in opposition to being from the mainland. It took the despair of watching our values erode, the feeling of being stripped of all that it means to be a Hongkonger for this new anxiety to emerge."

Under Hong Kong’s hybrid political structure, the District Council election is one of two avenues in which direct election takes place.<br></br>",

Given the small size of each constituency, councilors focus on providing constituent services, addressing noise complaints, parking issues, bike racks and the like. But winning a District Council seat can be a way to have an influence in higher-level politics — the Legislative Council (LegCo) election and the Electoral Committee for the Chief Executive."

Pro-Beijing candidates held 300 seats; they now hold just 58. Indeed, out of 452 seats up for grabs, pro-democracy candidates won about 80 percent, flipping more than half.<br></br>",

                    "The results are an unmistakable reprimand against the pro-Beijing government in Hong Kong, and to Beijing itself. Hong Kong has been engulfed in weekly pro-democracy protests since June, some of which have turned increasingly tense and violent in recent months. And yet, the message from Hongkongers was unequivocal: a rejection of Beijing’s encroachment and a clear mandate for democracy."
